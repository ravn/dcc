# Introduction

**DCC C Compiler** is an open source C compiler for **CP/M 2.2 on the Z80**. It supports C89 plus CP/M-relevant C99/C11 features. For every source
file it accepts, the DCC C Compiler translates the `.c` file to M80 assembly; M80 assembles the
result, and L80 links it into a CP/M `.COM` program.

The DCC C Compiler runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, but the programs it builds run under
CP/M. The [ntvcm](https://github.com/davidly/ntvcm) emulator and other popular
CP/M Z80 emulators run those programs, as do real Z80 CP/M 2.2 and 3.0 systems.

## Key Features

- **Cross-platform toolchain:** build CP/M `.COM` programs on Windows, macOS,
  or Linux with a single [dccmake command](02-build-and-link.md).
- **C89-based language with selected C99/C11 additions:** use Boolean types,
  designated initializers, variadic macros, static assertions, and a supported
  subset of variable-length arrays. The [conformance guide](01-c-conformance.md)
  distinguishes supported features from partial support and target exceptions.
- **Optimizing Z80 code generation:** MIR-based optimization, a separate
  peephole pass, and whole-program reachability analysis remove unnecessary
  code and runtime routines. See [compiler architecture](appendix/00-architecture.md)
  and [runtime optimization](appendix/01-dccrtlstrip.md).
- **Small, tailored runtime:** standard-library headers cover file and console
  I/O, allocation, strings, and single-precision math. Formatted-output support
  is selected per call; [CP/M services](10-system-and-cpm.md) provide access to
  the underlying operating system.
- **Source-level debugging for VS Code and AI agents:** both can use the debugger
  to investigate issues with breakpoints, watches, call stacks, memory inspection,
  and Z80 disassembly. Full debug builds favor inspectability;
  [optimized debug builds](00-vscode-debugging.md) retain release code generation.
- **Optional stack checks:** enable `dcc-stack-check=true` to detect stack
  reserve overflow, including supported VLA allocations.

!!! warning "A small-machine C implementation"
    DCC is not a fully conforming hosted C99/C11 implementation. Integers and
    pointers are 16-bit, `long` is 32-bit, and `float` is the only floating
    type. CP/M file semantics and library subsets differ from desktop C;
    start with [Types and conventions](03-types-and-conventions.md) and
    [Limitations](11-limitations.md) when porting code.

!!! success "Whole-program dead-code elimination"
  Normal `dccmake` builds enable LTO-style reachability analysis across every
  C source module. Uncalled functions, unused initialized globals/statics, and
  unused BSS objects in helper modules are removed before assembly; their
  otherwise-unused runtime dependencies disappear as well. Automatic local
  variables are optimized earlier by the compiler's MIR passes rather than by
  this whole-program step. See
  [Application and runtime optimization](appendix/01-dccrtlstrip.md).

!!! tip "Integrated VS Code debugging"
  Debug DCC programs directly in Visual Studio Code with source breakpoints,
  source and instruction stepping, call stacks, variables and watches, memory
  inspection, and linked Z80 disassembly. See
  [VS Code debugging](00-vscode-debugging.md) for setup and usage.

This manual describes the language accepted by the DCC C Compiler, the runtime library, and the
build path from C source to `.COM` file.

- Start with [Setting up the toolchain](00-setup-toolchain.md).
- See [Building and linking](02-build-and-link.md) for the normal build flow.
- See [C conformance and target exceptions](01-c-conformance.md),
  [Types and conventions](03-types-and-conventions.md), and
  [Operators](04-operators.md) for the language rules.
- Use the library reference for [assert.h](standard-lib/01-assert.md),
  [ctype.h](standard-lib/07-ctype.md), [errno.h](standard-lib/02-errno.md),
  [float.h](standard-lib/03-float.md), [limits.h](standard-lib/04-limits.md),
  [locale.h](standard-lib/17-locale.md),
  [math.h](standard-lib/08-math.md), [setjmp.h](standard-lib/09-setjmp.md),
  [signal.h](standard-lib/16-signal.md),
  [stdarg.h](standard-lib/10-stdarg.md), [stdbool.h](standard-lib/11-stdbool.md),
  [stddef.h](standard-lib/12-stddef.md), [stdint.h](standard-lib/13-stdint.md),
  [stdio.h](standard-lib/05-stdio.md), [stdlib.h](standard-lib/06-stdlib.md),
  [string.h](standard-lib/14-string.md), [time.h](standard-lib/15-time.md), and
  [system / CP/M services](10-system-and-cpm.md).
- Read [Limitations](11-limitations.md) before depending on hosted-C behavior.
- Try the [worked examples](12-examples.md) when you want complete programs.
- Use [Agentic skills](00-agent-skills.md) if you want an AI assistant to load the
  DCC C Compiler rules while working in another project.

## Runtime

`DCCRTL.MAC` is the runtime. It is Z80 assembly in M80/L80 syntax. It supplies:

- the `start` entry point, which sets up the heap and calls `main`,
- command-line parsing for `argc` and `argv`,
- the supported C library routines,
- integer and floating-point helpers used by generated code.

Normal builds also trim unused runtime routines before linking. The build steps
are shown in [Building and linking](02-build-and-link.md); the reachability
details are in the [`dccrtlstrip` appendix](appendix/01-dccrtlstrip.md).

The library reference lists the shipped declarations and explains their target
behavior. A familiar C or POSIX function name does not imply desktop semantics;
check its reference page and [Limitations](11-limitations.md) before porting code.

## Performance Snapshot

The chart compares `.COM` programs produced by the DCC C Compiler with CP/M-era and modern
CP/M-targeting compilers. Times come from `ntvcm -p` cycle counts converted to
the emulator's `approx ms at 4Mhz` value for Z80-mode runs. Sizes are CP/M file
sizes rounded to 128-byte records. Lower is better for `ms` and `bytes`.

![CP/M 2.2 benchmark comparison](images/table.jpg)

The benchmark names are the test programs: strings and memory (`tstring`),
sieve, digits of `e`, allocation (`tm`), tic-tac-toe (`ttt`), hexadecimal pi
digits (`pihex`), and matrix multiply (`mm`). Rows labelled `xcomp` are DCC C Compiler
output before `dccpeep`; rows labelled `dccpeep optimized` are after the
optimizer pass.

## Engineering Notes

DCC C Compiler was engineered agentically using [VS Code GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/copilot){: target="_blank" } and [Claude Code for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code){: target="_blank" }, with plenty of human intelligence, supervision, experience, and patience. It is unit tested against baselines grounded in modern C compilers and a platform-appropriate subset of the community-driven [c-testsuite](https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite).
