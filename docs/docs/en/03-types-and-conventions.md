# Types and conventions

The DCC C Compiler uses a compact 16-bit model. Knowing the exact widths up front avoids most
overflow and precision surprises.

## Type sizes

| Type | Size | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `char` | 8 bits | signed by default; range -128..127 |
| `unsigned char` | 8 bits | range 0..255; useful for raw bytes and table indexes |
| `_Bool`, `bool` | 8 bits | stores normalize to 0 or 1; include `stdbool.h` for `bool` |
| `int`, `short` | 16 bits | signed range -32768..32767; `int` is 16-bit, so watch for overflow |
| `unsigned int`, `unsigned short` | 16 bits | range 0..65535; use `%u` / `%x` / `%X` for formatted output |
| `long` | 32 bits | signed range -2147483648..2147483647; use `%ld` and the `l` length modifier |
| `unsigned long` | 32 bits | range 0..4294967295; use `%lu` / `%lx` / `%lX` |
| `float` | 32 bits | the only floating type — **no `double`** |
| pointer | 16 bits | flat CP/M address space |
| `size_t` | 16 bits | unsigned `int` |
| `ptrdiff_t` | 16 bits | signed `int`; result of subtracting two pointers |
| `wchar_t` | 16 bits | unsigned `int`; shared by [stddef.h](standard-lib/12-stddef.md) and [stdint.h](standard-lib/13-stdint.md) |
| `FILE` | 16 bits | `typedef int FILE`; streams are small handles |

The practical consequences:

- Use `long` (and `%ld`) whenever a value can exceed ±32767.
- Use `unsigned` / `unsigned long` when you need wraparound arithmetic or a
  logical right shift; signed right shift sign-extends.
- `float` carries about 7 decimal digits (a 24-bit significand). Integers up to
  `2^24` (16,777,216) are exact; beyond that, converting a large `long`
  to `float` rounds to the nearest single. See [Floating-point math](standard-lib/08-math.md)
  for the full set of precision gotchas.

## Useful constants

From [stdio](standard-lib/05-stdio.md):

- `EOF` = -1, `BUFSIZ` = 256, `SEEK_SET` / `SEEK_CUR` / `SEEK_END` = 0 / 1 / 2.

From [stdlib](standard-lib/06-stdlib.md):

- `EXIT_SUCCESS` = 0, `EXIT_FAILURE` = 1, `RAND_MAX` = 32767, `NULL` = 0.

From [errno.h](standard-lib/02-errno.md):

- `EDOM` = 33, `ERANGE` = 34.

## Fixed-width integer names (`stdint.h`)

[`stdint.h`](standard-lib/13-stdint.md) provides C99 integer typedefs and limit
macros that match the target model:

| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `int8_t` | signed 8-bit `char` |
| `uint8_t` | unsigned 8-bit `char` |
| `int16_t` | signed 16-bit `int` |
| `uint16_t` | unsigned 16-bit `int` |
| `int32_t` | signed 32-bit `long` |
| `uint32_t` | unsigned 32-bit `long` |
| `int_leastN_t` / `uint_leastN_t` | smallest available 8-, 16-, or 32-bit type |
| `int_fastN_t` / `uint_fastN_t` | fastest available 8-, 16-, or 32-bit type on Z80 |
| `intmax_t` / `uintmax_t` | signed / unsigned 32-bit `long` |
| `intptr_t` / `uintptr_t` | signed / unsigned 16-bit `int` |
| `wchar_t` | unsigned 16-bit `int` |

The runtime has no 64-bit integer support, so `stdint.h` intentionally stops at
the 32-bit `long` family.

## Command-line arguments

CP/M supplies one 128-byte command-tail area: a length byte followed by at most
127 text bytes. DCC treats nonzero bytes through ASCII space as delimiters
(including spaces and tabs), sets `argv[0]` to an empty string, and always
writes the required `argv[argc] == NULL` terminator. A valid maximum-length tail
can therefore contain at most 64 one-byte arguments separated by single
delimiters.

The 66-entry pointer vector and 128-byte tail copy occupy 260 contiguous
startup-scratch bytes immediately above the application's synthetic BSS.
They add no bytes to the loaded `.COM` and are outside the range startup must
zero; `__hstart` includes them, and the memory check keeps the stack reserve
above the complete scratch range.

The CP/M startup ABI has no error-return channel. If a malformed environment
supplies a length byte from 128 through 255, DCC deterministically truncates the
tail to the first 127 bytes before parsing it. Quoting and escape processing are
not added by the runtime parser: quote and backslash are literal bytes. This
preserves direct CP/M invocation semantics. Consequently, `execv()` rejects an
empty argument or an argument containing a byte through ASCII space with
`EINVAL`, rather than silently splitting or dropping it. `exec()` and `execv()`
emit up to the full 127-byte payload through byte `0xFF`; the length byte is
authoritative, so a trailing CR is present only when the payload is shorter.
An attempted 128th text byte fails with `E2BIG`.

## Integer limits (`limits.h`)

See [Integer limits](standard-lib/04-limits.md) for the generated `limits.h`
reference.

| Macro | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `CHAR_BIT` | 8 |
| `SCHAR_MIN` / `SCHAR_MAX` | -128 / 127 |
| `UCHAR_MAX` | 255 |
| `CHAR_MIN` / `CHAR_MAX` | -128 / 127 |
| `SHRT_MIN` / `SHRT_MAX` | -32768 / 32767 |
| `USHRT_MAX` | 65535 |
| `INT_MIN` / `INT_MAX` | -32768 / 32767 |
| `UINT_MAX` | 65535 |
| `LONG_MIN` / `LONG_MAX` | -2147483648 / 2147483647 |
| `ULONG_MAX` | 4294967295 |
| `UINT32_MAX` | 4294967295 |

## Floating limits (`float.h`)

[`float.h`](standard-lib/03-float.md) describes DCC C Compiler's single-precision reality:

| Macro | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `FLT_RADIX` | 2 |
| `FLT_MANT_DIG` | 24 |
| `FLT_DIG` | 6 |
| `FLT_EPSILON` | 1.19209290e-07F |
| `FLT_MIN` | 1.17549435e-38F |
| `FLT_MAX` | 3.40282347e+38F |
| `FLT_MIN_EXP` / `FLT_MAX_EXP` | -125 / 128 |
| `FLT_MIN_10_EXP` / `FLT_MAX_10_EXP` | -37 / 38 |

The DCC C Compiler has no `double` or `long double`. The `DBL_*` and `LDBL_*` macros are
defined as aliases of the `FLT_*` values so source that references those names
still compiles, but they intentionally reflect the single-precision target:

- `DBL_MANT_DIG`, `DBL_DIG`, `DBL_EPSILON`, `DBL_MIN`, `DBL_MAX`,
  `DBL_MIN_EXP`, `DBL_MAX_EXP`, `DBL_MIN_10_EXP`, `DBL_MAX_10_EXP`
- `LDBL_MANT_DIG`, `LDBL_DIG`, `LDBL_EPSILON`, `LDBL_MIN`, `LDBL_MAX`,
  `LDBL_MIN_EXP`, `LDBL_MAX_EXP`, `LDBL_MIN_10_EXP`, `LDBL_MAX_10_EXP`

## Zero-initialized data

In a normal final application build, uninitialized globals and uninitialized
function-scope `static` objects are backed by the DCC C Compiler's synthetic BSS range. The
compiler emits the range as `__bssb .. __bsse`, and the runtime `start`
entrypoint zeroes that range before calling `main`. So an uninitialized global
array is guaranteed to be all zeros, as C89 requires:

```c
char buffer[4096];   /* in BSS, guaranteed zero at program start */

int main(void)
{
    return buffer[0]; /* always 0 */
}
```

  Function-scope `static` objects use the same storage model: the compiler gives
  them hidden global backing storage, then ordinary references inside the function
  refer to that backing object.

  ```c
  int next_id(void)
  {
    static int counter;     /* zero before the first call */
    return ++counter;
  }
  ```

  Separately compiled helper modules (`dcc -c` / `-module`) use ordinary `DS`
  storage for their uninitialized globals so multiple modules do not overlap the
  final application's synthetic BSS range. The zeroing guarantee above describes
  the normal final app translation unit linked with `DCCRTL.MAC` / `RTLMIN.MAC`.

## Supported pragmas

DCC accepts `#pragma` directives for source compatibility. Unknown pragmas are
ignored, so headers shared with other compilers can usually keep vendor-specific
directives in place. The pragmas below have DCC-specific behavior:

| Pragma | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `#pragma once` | Marks the current source or header file as include-once. Later includes of the same canonical host path are skipped. The directive is honored only when it appears in an active preprocessor branch. |
| `#pragma stack_check(on)` | Enables stack-overflow guard emission from this point forward in the translation unit. |
| `#pragma stack_check(off)` | Disables stack-overflow guard emission from this point forward in the translation unit. |
| `#pragma push_macro("NAME")` | Saves the current definition state of macro `NAME` on DCC's macro stack. |
| `#pragma pop_macro("NAME")` | Restores the most recently pushed definition state for macro `NAME`; if the macro was not defined at push time, it is undefined. |

`#pragma once` is handled during include splicing, before normal tokenization, so
it works through relative-path aliases such as `"foo.h"` and `"./foo.h"` when
they resolve to the same host file. It also follows DCC's active conditional
state: a pragma inside `#if 0` is ignored, while a pragma made active by `#else`,
`#elif`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, or earlier active `#define` / `#undef` directives
is honored.

[`-fstack-check`](02-build-and-link.md#options-that-affect-the-runtime) sets
the initial stack-check state for the translation unit. `#pragma stack_check(on)`
and `#pragma stack_check(off)` then control guard emission in source order. The
pragma affects function prologues and VLA allocations emitted after the directive;
it does not retroactively change code already emitted.

```c
void normal_default(void) { }   /* uses the command-line/default state */

#pragma stack_check(on)
void guarded_region(void) { }   /* emits call __stchk */

#pragma stack_check(off)
void unguarded_region(void) { } /* no stack-check prologue */
```

## Variable-length arrays

DCC supports a practical subset of C99 variable-length arrays (VLAs):
a **local array whose size is a run-time value**, allocated on the stack when
its declaration is reached and released when its block is left. This is meant
for runtime-sized scratch storage on the 16-bit Z80/CP/M target, not full
variably-modified type support. The [C conformance](01-c-conformance.md) page
lists the summary status; this section is the practical guide.

### Supported

A local array whose **outermost** dimension is a run-time expression, with any
constant inner dimensions:

```c
void f(int n)
{
    int  a[n];          /* 1-D VLA                        */
    char buf[n + 1];    /* any run-time size expression   */
    int  grid[n][3];    /* variable outer, constant inner */
    /* a, buf, grid decay to pointers exactly like fixed arrays */
}
```

- The size expression is evaluated **once**, when the declaration is reached.
- In multidimensional arrays such as `grid[n][3]`, the inner dimensions must be
  compile-time constants because they define the row stride used for indexing.
- **Block-scope reclamation.** The array lives until its enclosing block exits,
  so a VLA inside a loop does not grow the stack — each iteration reuses the
  same storage:

  ```c
  for (i = 0; i < iters; i++) {
      int scratch[n];     /* allocated and freed every iteration */
      /* ... use scratch ... */
  }                       /* stack pointer restored here each pass */
  ```

- Reclamation happens on **every** normal exit from the block: fall-through,
  `break`, `continue`, `return`, and a `goto` that leaves the scope. A `goto`
  out of one or more VLA scopes is fully supported in **both** directions
  (forward and backward) and restores the stack to exactly the target label's
  scope, even when it leaves several nested VLA scopes at once.
- Recursion works: each call frame gets its own VLA and releases it on return.
- With `-fstack-check`, the run-time allocation is bounds-checked, so an
  oversized VLA aborts gracefully instead of colliding with the heap. VLAs draw
  from the same `-stack` reserve as ordinary locals; size it for the deepest
  expected allocation (see [Building and linking](02-build-and-link.md)).

### Not supported (diagnosed, never miscompiled)

- A **variable inner** dimension, e.g. `int a[n][m]`, because the row stride
  would be a run-time value. Only the outermost dimension may vary. Use an
  explicit index computation or `malloc` for a fully dynamic 2-D array.
- Jumping **into** a VLA's scope with `goto`, `case`, or `default` (which would
  bypass the allocation) is rejected, matching a conforming compiler. (Jumping
  *out of* a VLA scope is fine and reclaims the stack — see above.)
- Variably-modified **types** beyond the array object itself — VLA `typedef`s,
  pointers-to-VLA (`int (*p)[n]`), and run-time-bound VLA function parameters —
  are not modelled.

### `sizeof` on VLAs

`sizeof` applied to a whole VLA produces the array's run-time byte size, matching
standard C expectations for the supported VLA subset. Constant-size subobjects
remain compile-time sizes:

```c
int a[n][3];
memset(a, 0, sizeof a);        /* run-time value: n * 3 * sizeof(int) */
sizeof a[0];                  /* compile-time row size: 3 * sizeof(int) */
```
