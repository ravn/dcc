 *     "ld (ix+O),l" / "ld (ix+O+1),h" pair right before the label),
 *   - that label is a real loop (something later jumps back to it - and,
 *     since a loop can have more than one back-edge, e.g. an early
 *     "continue"-style path, every reference up through the LAST one
 *     found counts as still being inside the loop, not just the first),
 *   - never has its address taken - checked two ways: no reference to
 *     its offset anywhere in the function outside one of eight
 *     whitelisted shapes (loaded into hl, de, or a's low/high byte, or
 *     stored back from hl as a pair - never a cp, never anything else),
 *     and no bare "ld de,<off>" / "ld hl,<off>" anywhere either, which is
 *     how dcc compiles "&local" (push ix / pop hl / ld de,<off> /
 *     add hl,de) - the offset there is a plain immediate, not "(ix<off>)"
 *     text, so the first check alone can't see it,
 *   - and B/C are completely unused anywhere else in the function (no
 *     calls at all - every user-function call in this ABI clobbers every
 *     register, so a live register cache can never safely cross one - no
 *     block-repeat instructions, no explicit b/c/bc token)
 * is kept in BC for the function's entire body instead of round-tripping
 * through its frame slot on every use. This is the same
 * "enumerate exactly what's recognized, decline on anything else" design
 * as pass_byte_loop_counter_to_reg_c, generalized from an 8-bit
 * decrementing counter to a 16-bit variable with an arbitrary update.
 *
 * An earlier version scoped the BC-freedom requirement to just the loop
 * (not the whole function), reasoning that code before the init-write
 * can't matter and code after the loop can't reference the variable
 * again anyway. That's true, but cost two real bugs to get right (an
 * incomplete loop-extent bound from only finding the first of several
 * back-edges let BC get silently clobbered mid-loop in tests/forint.c;
 * and it never even caught the &local case above, corrupting
 * tests/tforsco.c) while never actually paying for itself - its
 * motivating case, is_attacked's call-free knight-check loop ahead of
 * its calls to attacked_by_slider, turned out to be blocked anyway by an
 * unrelated pre-existing pass already claiming BC for that loop's own
 * array index. Reverted to the simpler, whole-function requirement.
 *
 * Does not attempt to reclaim the now-unused frame slot; leaving it
 * allocated but unreferenced wastes at most 2 bytes of stack per call,
 * and avoids needing to renumber every other frame offset in the
 * function.

/*
 * pass_byte_loop_var_to_reg_c:
 *
 * A 1-byte local variable (a negative ix offset) initialized once,
 * immediately before a loop's own top label (a single "ld (ix+O),l"
 * right before the label - the same shape pass_word_loop_var_to_reg_bc
 * looks for, just one instruction instead of a pair), referenced
 * elsewhere in the function only via one of four whitelisted shapes -
 * loaded into l or a, or stored back from l or a - is kept in register C
 * for the function's entire body instead of round-tripping through its
 * frame slot on every use, under the exact same conditions as that pass
 * (a real loop, possibly with more than one back-edge; never has its
 * address taken, checked the same two ways; C completely unused
 * anywhere else in the function).
 *
 * Deliberately narrower in what it rewrites than the word version: it
 * only ever replaces the memory fetch/store itself ("ld l,(ix+O)" ->
 * "ld l,c", not anything downstream of it). For a signed byte used in a
 * 16-bit context, dcc's codegen sign-extends after every load ("ld a,l /
 * rlca / sbc a,a / ld h,a") - this pass leaves that sequence completely
 * untouched and just feeds it from a register instead of memory. That
 * still saves the full memory-load cost (a direct (ix+d) byte fetch is
 * comparable to the pair fetch pass_word_loop_var_to_reg_bc eliminates),
 * without needing to reason about every way dcc might phrase "produce
 * this byte's sign-extended 16-bit value" - including the existing
 * a_tracks_ix fusion, which already elides a redundant reload into A
 * right before this pass would apply and needs no awareness of this
 * pass at all, since it never touches "(ix+O)" text itself.

 * of register C, since M80 (and m80c) don't recognize the "iyl"/"iyh"
 * mnemonic spellings directly: each use site emits the raw opcode bytes as
 * "db 0FDh,xx" instead (DEC IYL=2Dh, LD A,IYL=7Dh, LD IYL,A=6Fh, LD E,IYL=
 * 5Dh, INC IYL=2Ch). These used to be M80 MACRO/ENDM definitions invoked by
 * name (IYDECL/IYLDA/IYSTA/IYLDE), but m80c - the native assembler that
 * later became the default toolchain - never implemented MACRO/ENDM, so
 * that indirection was replaced with the equivalent literal bytes at each
 * site; the nested-loop collision check below now recognizes the "db
 * 0FDh," prefix instead of an "IY" name prefix.
 *
 * Because nothing else touches IY (see scan_local_func_labels above), this
 * pass allows ANY call inside the loop body, not just __mods/__divs, except
 * one that is_local_func_label flags as another function in this same file
 * - declined exactly like pass_byte_loop_counter_to_reg_c declines a call
 * that isn't __mods/__divs.
 *
 * "ld l,(ix+off)" can't become a single "ld l,iyl": the FD prefix redirects
 * EVERY H/L reference in an instruction, so "ld l,iyl" would actually
 * encode "ld iyl,iyl" - there is no single-instruction undocumented form
 * that reads IYL into the real L register (E, unaffected by the H/L
 * substitution rule, has no such problem - "ld e,iyl" is a clean single
 * instruction). That whitelisted shape expands to two lines (the LD A,IYL
 * byte sequence, then "ld l,a") instead of a single-line replacement.

 * counter-registerization pass to prove that an early-exit path out of
 * its loop (e.g. an `if (...) return X;` inside the loop body) never
 * reads the counter's frame slot while it's stale - the register holds
 * the authoritative value for the whole loop, and the write-back that
 * resyncs the frame slot only runs once, at the loop's own normal exit,
 * never on an early-exit path. A conditional jump (ambiguous which way
 * execution goes), a call (could do anything), or running out of hops
 * without reaching "ld sp,ix" is treated as unprovable - a decline, not a
 * misapplication. */
