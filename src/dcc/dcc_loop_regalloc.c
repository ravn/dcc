/*
 * dcc_loop_regalloc.c - loop-scoped BC register promotion.
 *
 * dcc_func.c already promotes at most one read-only parameter into BC for a
 * whole function's lifetime (find_bc_regalloc_candidate,
 * try_speculative_bc_regalloc_function_body). This file generalizes the
 * same underlying trick - "this scalar's stack slot never changes across
 * the span we care about, so keep its value in BC instead of reloading it
 * on every reference" - from whole-function scope down to a single loop, so
 * a function that has a call elsewhere (disqualifying it from the whole-
 * function scheme entirely) can still benefit if its hot loop itself has
 * none, and so body-local candidates (excluded from the whole-function
 * scheme because their Sym isn't stable across dcc_func.c's separate scan/
 * codegen passes) become eligible too, since this mechanism never leaves
 * the one codegen pass that already has a live, stable Sym* for them.
 *
 * Candidate eligibility reuses dcc_licm.c's own conservative modified-name
 * scan (licm_scan_modified) verbatim: a candidate must be referenced in the
 * loop's condition/increment/body but never appear in that scan's result
 * set (assigned, incremented/decremented, or address-taken), and the scan
 * overflowing (a call, nested loop, switch, or goto anywhere in the loop)
 * declines promoting anything in this loop at all - exactly the same bar
 * LICM itself already holds its own hoists to, reused rather than
 * reinvented for a second time in this file.
 *
 * Verification of a read-only (Phase 1) candidate reuses dcc_regalloc.c's
 * regalloc_buffer_finalize unmodified: it scans a buffer of emitted
 * assembly text for anything that clobbers b/c/bc without dcc's own
 * recognized load/store idioms, tracking loop back-edges via label/jump
 * text so a linear single-pass scan still catches a hazard that would only
 * appear on a loop's second-and-later iteration. Nothing in that function
 * assumes its buffer is a whole function body rather than one loop's own
 * emitted span - "any call in this text to something other than a
 * DCCRTL.MAC-contracted BC-preserving runtime helper" (buf_has_unsafe_call,
 * dcc_regalloc.c) is exactly the right question whether "this text" is a
 * function or a loop.
 *
 * Phase 2 promotes candidates the loop also WRITES (assigns to, and/or
 * increments/decrements) - the actual replacement for dccpeep's half-dozen
 * near-duplicate loop-counter/accumulator-to-register passes. This needs
 * two things Phase 1 didn't: a place for a write to actually go (new
 * REG_BC branches in emit_store_hl_to_sym_direct/emit_incdec_sym_direct,
 * dcc_symbols.c - previously dead code, since the whole-function BC
 * candidate is read-only by construction) and a stricter verifier
 * (loop_regalloc_write_candidate_safe, below) than regalloc_buffer_
 * finalize's lenient one, because a write candidate's frame slot is
 * intentionally stale for the whole loop - reload-repairing from it, as
 * the lenient policy would, could silently substitute a stale value. See
 * that function's own header comment for the full argument. Eligible loops
 * are naturally single-exit (see loop_regalloc_find_bc_candidate's header
 * comment), so a single spill store right after the loop is always
 * sufficient to resync the frame slot before anything downstream reads it.

 * the first write happens and stays that way until try_loop_regalloc_bc_
 * write's spill store, emitted once, immediately after the loop and before
 * any code that could read the global again - the exact same shape
