/*
 * dcc_licm.c - general loop-invariant code motion for `for` loop bodies.
 *
 * dcc_ast_gen_stmt.c already hoists three narrow, single-statement-body
 * shapes (a loop-invariant lvalue address, a row-invariant 2D array read,
 * and a global-member value proven invariant via dcc_global_scan.c). This
 * file generalizes the same idea - "the same value gets recomputed every
 * iteration even though it can't actually change" - to loop bodies of any
 * shape (multiple statements, nested ifs), for the narrower but still very
 * common case of a pure scalar-arithmetic subexpression (no memory access,
 * no calls, no side effects) that doesn't depend on anything the loop
 * itself modifies.
 *
 * Motivating case (tests/00040.c, an 8-queens solver profiled at 98.5% of
 * total runtime in one function):
 *
 *     int chk(int x, int y)
 *     {
 *         int i, r;
 *         for (r=i=0; i<8; i++) {
 *             r = r + t[x + 8*i];
 *             r = r + t[i + 8*y];   -- 8*y recomputed every iteration
 *             ...
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * `y` is a parameter, never assigned anywhere in the loop, so `8*y` is the
 * same value on every one of the loop's iterations - and this shape (a
 * multi-statement body with several `if`s) doesn't match any of the three
 * existing narrow hoists at all.
 *
 * Design, deliberately conservative at every step (an unrecognized shape or
 * anything that could plausibly break the invariance argument is always a
 * decline, never a guess - matching dcc_array_narrow.c/dcc_global_scan.c):
 *
 *   1. Scan the loop's condition, increment, and body for every plain
 *      identifier that is assigned, incremented/decremented, or has its
 *      address taken anywhere - that's the set nothing invariant may depend
 *      on. Any function call anywhere, or any statement/expression shape
 *      this doesn't specifically recognize, marks the WHOLE set as
 *      "modified" (i.e. declines every candidate), since a call could modify
 *      anything through an escaped pointer or global that a purely lexical
 *      scan can't rule out.
 *   2. Walk the body looking for the largest (outermost) subexpressions that
 *      are pure scalar arithmetic (int-sized, no pointers, no memory access,
 *      no calls) and reference only locals/params outside that modified
 *      set - never descending further into an eligible subexpression once
 *      found, so `t[x + 8*i]`'s inner `8*i` is correctly left alone (`i` is
 *      modified) while `t[i + 8*y]`'s inner `8*y` is found and taken whole.
 *   3. For each distinct candidate (by structural equality - the same
 *      subexpression appearing more than once shares one temp), compute its
 *      value once, into a fresh compiler-temp local, before the loop.
 *   4. Return a rewritten copy of the body with every occurrence replaced by
 *      a reference to its temp; the original body node is never mutated,
 *      matching ast_hoist_row_invariant_2d_reads's sharing discipline
 *      (only allocate a fresh copy of a node when something beneath it
 *      actually changed).
 *
 * Runs independently of, and after, the three narrow hoists in
 * ast_gen_for_stmt - only when none of them already produced a hoist_body,
 * to keep this file's interaction with that existing code trivial.

 * return, or any node kind not explicitly recognized below (nested loops,
 * goto/labels, compound literals, ...) sets mod->overflowed - safe (declines
 * every candidate) rather than risking a missed modification a purely
 * lexical scan can't see through.
 *
 * AST_SWITCH and AST_CONTINUE are both explicitly safe, not just "not
 * unrecognized": a `continue` anywhere never skips this loop's own eventual
 * exit (it jumps to the increment/condition test, still inside the loop's
 * normal flow), and a `switch` is scanned via licm_scan_modified_switch_
 * body below, which is break-aware - a `break` reached directly inside a
 * switch's own body targets that switch (via break_stack[nflow-1] at
 * whichever nesting level is innermost at runtime - see ast_gen_stmt's
 * AST_SWITCH/AST_BREAK cases, dcc_ast_gen_stmt.c), not this loop, so it
 * doesn't skip this loop's exit either. A `break` reached OUTSIDE any
 * switch still overflows here (the normal AST_BREAK case, declined via the
 * default case below) since THAT one does target this loop directly.
 *
 * AST_CALL to a function declared _Noreturn (Sym::is_noreturn) is also
 * explicitly safe: whatever it clobbers can't matter, because control never
 * returns to any point after it on this path for this candidate's
 * eligibility to be evaluated against - only its own argument expressions
 * (which do still execute) need scanning.
 *
 * AST_CALL to a function dcc's inliner has captured as substitutable
 * (is_inline_substitutable, dcc_func.c) is likewise not an automatic
 * overflow: dcc's real codegen-time substitution (try_gen_inline_call_ast,
 * invoked from gen_call_ast during ast_gen_expr) replaces the call with the
 * callee's own captured body at the call site, so by the time this AST_CALL
 * node reaches actual codegen it may never become a real "call" instruction
 * at all - declining every loop that merely calls an inlinable helper (this
 * file's motivating change: forint.c's eval_e, whose hot loop calls
 * get_sym_val/set_sym_val for every variable access) would be needlessly
 * conservative. After scanning the call's own arguments normally, this
 * recurses into the callee's captured inline_return_expr/inline_stmt_expr/
 * inline_stmt_body as if it were written at the call site - parameter names
 * inside that captured body are left as-is (real substitution onto this
 * call's actual arguments happens later, at codegen time) and scanned as
 * ordinary identifiers, which is correct for this purpose: this scan only
 * cares about what's modified/address-taken/called, and dcc's own scoping
 * already prevents a parameter name from colliding with an unrelated
 * caller-scope identifier of the same name. g_licm_inline_expand_stack
 * guards against a self- or mutually-recursive chain of such functions
 * (see its own comment). A call to anything else - an ordinary function, a
 * function pointer, or an unresolvable callee - still overflows, since it
 * could modify anything through an escaped pointer or global that this
 * lexical scan can't rule out. */

 * Cross-statement CSE: the same pure subexpression appearing more than once
 * among the loop body's top-level statements (e.g. `x+i` tested in two
 * different `if` conditions - `if (x+i < 8 & y+i < 8)` and
 * `if (x+i < 8 & y-i >= 0)`). This is a fundamentally different concern from
 * the invariant hoist above - `x+i` depends on the loop's own induction
 * variable `i`, so it is NOT loop-invariant and correctly never reaches
 * licm_collect_candidates - but it is still computed twice on every
 * iteration for no reason, since nothing between the two uses can change it.
 *
 * An earlier version of this pass also counted (and hoisted based on) a
 * subexpression repeated between an if's own condition and its own
 * then/else body. That was measured to be a net regression on
 * tests/00040.c (+15% cycles): the temp is stored unconditionally, every
 * iteration, to serve a use inside the guarded body that may never actually
 * run (chk()'s if-conditions are pruning checks, false most of the time) -
 * so the store/reload overhead is paid far more often than the recompute it
 * was meant to avoid. Profitability here is therefore judged ONLY by
 * occurrences that are themselves unconditional - a top-level statement not
 * guarded by any if, or an if's own condition (which always runs, whichever
 * way it goes) - never an if's then/else. Once a candidate qualifies on
 * that basis, every occurrence (guarded body included) is still rewritten
 * to use the temp, as a free bonus.
 *
 * Unlike the invariant hoist, this cannot compute the shared value once via
 * a direct codegen call at rewrite time (that would only run once, before
 * the loop, which is wrong - the value depends on `i` and must be
 * recomputed every iteration). Instead this builds an ordinary `temp =
 * expr;` assignment AST node and splices it into the body's top-level
 * statement list once, ahead of every statement, so it gets normal
 * per-iteration codegen exactly like any other statement in the body.
