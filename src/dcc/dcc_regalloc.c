 *     reference anywhere in the body reads or writes through whatever

 * shapes emit_store_hl_to_sym_direct/emit_incdec_sym_direct/emit_load_sym_
 * value_direct/ast_byte_operand's kind-1 hooks produce; anything else
 * discards the whole attempt. E has no shadow to fall back on (its frame
 * slot is never kept in sync - see gen_local_decl_after_type), so there is
 * nothing to reload from; a real clobber here is unrecoverable, not just
 * inconvenient.
 *
 * BC is different, and gets a genuinely more permissive treatment: bc_cand
 * is read-only by construction (find_bc_regalloc_candidate excludes any
 * candidate ever written to), so its ORIGINAL incoming-parameter stack slot
 * (ix+off / ix+off+1) never changes for the life of the function - it is
 * already a perfect, always-valid shadow, for free, with no bookkeeping
 * needed to keep it in sync. So instead of declining outright the moment
 * anything else touches b/c/bc (e.g. tbig.c's get_stamp parking a scratch
 * value via push bc/pop bc for unrelated long arithmetic), this pass tracks
 * whether bc is currently "trusted" (untouched by anything but a recognized
 * line since the last known-good point) as it walks forward, and - the
 * moment it's asked to trust bc again at a recognized value-read site while
 * untrusted - REWRITES the buffer, inserting a fresh reload from that
 * always-correct original slot right there, before continuing. This is
 * deliberately conservative in one direction: it does not attempt to prove
 * a "push bc ... pop bc" pair actually restores the original value (which
 * it usually does) and skip the reload in that case - every untrusted point
 * gets a reload whether or not one was strictly needed, trading a few extra
 * instructions for staying exact rather than tracking real stack-balance
 * semantics from flat text.
 *
 * A "call" to anything other than one of g_safe_runtime_calls' seven
 * DCCRTL.MAC-contracted helpers (see buf_has_unsafe_call above) still fails
 * the whole attempt outright, for both candidates: current_function_has_call
 * only detects an explicit C call syntactically present in the source, not
 * an implicit runtime-helper call (e.g. `call __mulu`) codegen may still
 * insert for a `*`, `/`, `%`, or long/float operation with no call syntax
 * visible at all - this feature's leaf-only gate otherwise depends on there
 * being truly zero calls of any kind, and an arbitrary call's effect on
 * bc/de is not something a reload can safely paper over (unlike a same-
 * function scratch use, it's not visible in this text at all); the seven
 * whitelisted helpers are the sole exception, trusted by documented contract
 * rather than by anything this scan itself can verify. Neither candidate's
 * own address may ever be taken either - see g_regalloc_address_escaped
 * (dcc_symbols.c), checked separately by the caller.
 *
 * On success, *out_f is a rewound tmpfile holding the (possibly BC-
 * reload-rewritten) content to commit - the caller must fclose it. On
 * failure, *out_f is untouched.
 *
 * Not static: dcc_loop_regalloc.c calls this directly to verify a single
 * loop's speculatively-generated body, passing e_cand=NULL (loop-scoped
 * promotion only ever targets BC, matching find_bc_regalloc_candidate's own
 * word-sized/read-only/never-address-taken candidate shape - see that
 * file). Nothing about this scan assumes its buffer covers a whole function
 * body rather than one loop's own emitted span - the "any call anywhere"
 * check and the loop-header self-consistency check are exactly as sound,
 * and exactly as needed, scoped to just a loop's own text. */
