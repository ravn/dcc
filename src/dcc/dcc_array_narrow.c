/*
 * dcc_array_narrow.c - detect int arrays whose every stored element value is
 * provably in [0,255], so their declared element type can be narrowed to
 * unsigned char before normal codegen runs.
 *
 * Byte arrays are already a completely ordinary, fully-supported C
 * construct in dcc - narrowing an array's type is the entire fix; no new
 * codegen is needed, since type_index_elem_size() and friends already
 * derive addressing arithmetic from the element type dynamically. The hard
 * part, and the only thing this file does, is proving the narrowing is
 * safe.
 *
 * Two independent questions have to be answered, both by lexical/AST
 * scanning rather than symbol-table-based analysis (matching
 * dcc_global_scan.c's approach for the analogous whole-file question):
 *
 *   1. Does this array's name ever escape as a bare pointer (passed to a
 *      function, assigned to a pointer, etc.)? If so, some other code this
 *      scan cannot see might store an unbounded value through it, so
 *      narrowing is declined outright. A bare occurrence of the name not
 *      immediately followed by '[' is treated as an escape.
 *
 *   2. Is every value ever stored into the array provably in [0,255]? This
 *      needs both an upper bound *and* non-negativity - storing a negative
 *      int into unsigned char wraps to a large positive value, which is not
 *      the same value read back, so an upper-bound-only proof is not
 *      sufic.ient. Values that are themselves expressions referencing other
 *      local scalars (not just literals) require bounding those scalars
 *      too, by tracing every place they are reassigned within the same
 *      scope - which can require mutual reasoning (variable X's bound
 *      depends on array A's values, and A's bound depends on X), handled
 *      by hypothesize-then-verify: assume every name in the dependency
 *      closure has the target property, then check every reassignment site
 *      for every name in the closure is consistent with that assumption.
 *      This is a coinductive safety argument, not an inductive one - it is
 *      valid because the property being checked (nonneg-and-bounded) is
 *      preserved by the recognized operators, not because it needs a base
 *      case to build up from.
 *
 * The rule set for "is this expression nonneg and bounded by K" is
 * deliberately small and conservative: literals, +, *, / (bound derived
 * from operands, with / requiring a positive divisor), % (bounded by the
 * divisor's own bound minus 1, and only when the dividend is separately
 * proven nonneg), a bare reference to another name in the assumption set,
 * an index into an array in the assumption set, and a call to a
 * no-argument function whose entire body is a single return statement
 * (recursively bounded the same way). Anything else - unrecognized
 * operators, a variable outside the same function, a function with
 * parameters or a body of more than one statement - is an unconditional
 * decline, never a guess: this can only under-narrow (miss an
 * optimization), never over-narrow (corrupt a value), which is the
 * required safety direction throughout this codebase's other lexical
 * scans (see local_name_used_ahead, local_name_address_taken_ahead,
 * scan_global_write_info).
