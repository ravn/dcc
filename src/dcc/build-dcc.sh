#
# build-dcc.sh - build the modularised dcc compiler (separate compilation).
#
# Compiles each module translation unit (dcc.c and the dcc_*.c files, all of
# which include the umbrella header dcc.h) and links them into the `dcc`
# executable at the repo root, matching the flags used for the monolithic
# build so the produced binary and its generated assembly are equivalent.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):
#   sh src/dcc/build-dcc.sh            # build ./dcc at the repo root
#   sh src/dcc/build-dcc.sh -o out/dcc # build to a custom path
#
# The companion peephole/runtime tools are built by mmacos.sh / m.sh / m.bat
# from src/dccpeep/dccpeep.c and src/dccrtlstrip/dccrtlstrip.c; this script
# only builds the modular dcc front end.
