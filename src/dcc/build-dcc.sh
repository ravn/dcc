# build-dcc.sh - build the modularised dcc compiler (separate compilation).
#
# Compiles each module translation unit (dcc.c and the dcc_*.c files, all of
# which include the shared dcc contracts) and links them into the `dcc`
# executable at the repo root using the portable C11 host baseline.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):
#   sh src/dcc/build-dcc.sh            # build ./dcc at the repo root
#   sh src/dcc/build-dcc.sh -o out/dcc # build to a custom path
#
# The companion peephole/runtime tools are built by mmacos.sh / m.sh / m.bat
# from src/dccpeep/dccpeep.c and src/dccrtlstrip/dccrtlstrip.c; this script
# only builds the modular dcc front end.

# build tool, not the Z80 target, so that's the only reason to link it any
# particular way. Not possible on macOS (no static libSystem to link

# static libc dev package, e.g. glibc-static, isn't installed).
