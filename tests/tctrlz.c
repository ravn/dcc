/* tctrlz.c - an embedded (non-trailing) 0x1A (Ctrl-Z) byte is the classic
 * CP/M text-file EOF marker, but only fgets() in dccrtl treats it that way;
 * fread() and fgetc() are binary-safe and don't special-case it at all. This
 * pins down that asymmetry: fgets() must stop exactly at the embedded 0x1A
 * (and feof() must then read true, even though real data follows it in the
 * file), while fread() and fgetc() must see every byte, including the 0x1A
 * itself and everything after it.
 *
 * fread()/fgetc() checks below look at specific byte positions rather than
 * an exact total count: the fixture is under 128 bytes, so the write pads
 * the rest of its record with more Ctrl-Z (see tpadread.c) and a
 * binary-safe reader correctly keeps going into that padding too - that's
 * tpadread.c's finding, not this one, so it's deliberately not asserted
 * here as an exact byte count.
