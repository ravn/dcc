# dcc test suite

This folder holds C source programs used to exercise dcc's C89 base language,
selected C99/C11 additions, CP/M-80/Z80 target model, and runtime, together with
the expected-output baselines used to verify them.

## Layout

```
tests/
  _test_overrides.json # per-test run config (args, stack_size, ignore)
  <name>.c          # a test program (compiled + run by the harness)
  E.PAS, E.COB, ... # fixture input files consumed by some interpreters
  baselines/
    <name>.txt      # expected stdout for tests/<name>.c
  diagnostics/
    <name>.c        # compile-fail diagnostic tests
    baselines/
      <name>.txt    # expected normalized dcc stderr/stdout
  extended-tests/
    c-testsuite/    # imported c89/c99/c11 single-exec corpus
```

## How tests and baselines relate

Each test program `tests/<name>.c` has a **matching baseline file**
`tests/baselines/<name>.txt`. The baseline contains the **exact expected
standard output** that the program produces when compiled with `dcc` and run
under the emulator (`ntvcm`).

The relationship is **by file name**:

| Test source            | Expected output baseline          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tests/sieve.c`        | `tests/baselines/sieve.txt`       |
| `tests/ttt.c`          | `tests/baselines/ttt.txt`         |
| `tests/cobint.c`       | `tests/baselines/cobint.txt`      |

The test runner (`scripts/runall.ps1`) builds each main-suite `*.c` file, runs
it, and compares the captured stdout against the like-named file in
`baselines/`.
Because matching is keyed on the **app name** (not position in a list), the
order in which tests are discovered or run does not matter.

An app can also declare `extra_scenarios` in `_test_overrides.json` to rerun
its *same already-built* COM against additional (args, fixtures) inputs -
e.g. `pint` also runs against `TTT.PAS` in addition to its primary `E.PAS`.
Each scenario gets its own baseline at `tests/baselines/<name>_<suffix>.txt`
(e.g. `tests/baselines/pint_ttt.txt`), checked independently of the primary
baseline. This exists so a bug that only manifests with one input's
data/control-flow shape (see commit `077d30c`) can't hide behind a single
fixture that happens to work.

> Note: a few tests take command-line arguments or need a larger stack. Those
> parameters live in `tests/_test_overrides.json` (keys: `args`, `stdin`,
> `stack_size`, `dcc_args`, `dcc_floatio`, `dcc_longio`, `ignore`,
> `extra_scenarios`). For example `ttt` is run with `10`, and `cobint` reads
> `e.cob`.

## Running the suite

From the repo root, with PowerShell 7+:

```pwsh
# Build + run every test, verify against tests/baselines/ (parallel by default)
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1

# Also run the extended c-testsuite corpus after the main suite
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Extended

# Sequential fallback (one app at a time in the shared build/ dir)
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Serial

# Build only one optimization pass (default builds both)
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode peep     # optimized (dccpeep) only
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode nopeep   # unoptimized only

# Build without the stack-overflow guard (on by default)
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -NoStackCheck

# Keep the per-invocation build/run-<pid>/ folder instead of removing it on exit
pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -KeepBuild
```

By default the suite builds each app in **both** optimization modes \u2014 `peep`
(optimized, via the dccpeep peephole optimizer) and `nopeep` (unoptimized) \u2014
and verifies both against the same baseline, so a default run does two builds
per app. Use `-Mode peep` or `-Mode nopeep` to build just one.

By default the suite runs **in parallel** (each app builds in its own
`build/<app>/` subdirectory), which is much faster on multi-core machines. Each
parallel invocation is isolated under a `build/run-<pid>/` folder that is
removed automatically on exit (pass `-KeepBuild` to keep it for debugging). Pass
`-Serial` to build sequentially in the shared `build/` directory. The
lightweight stack-overflow guard (`-fstack-check`) is on by default; use
`-NoStackCheck` to disable it.

A test **passes** when its program builds, runs, and its stdout matches the
corresponding `baselines/<name>.txt` byte-for-byte (line endings normalized to
LF). A test with no baseline file is still built and run, but reported as
"no baseline" rather than verified.

## Running compile-fail diagnostic tests

The diagnostic suite under `tests/diagnostics/` verifies compiler errors for
programs that are expected to fail during `dcc` compilation. The runner captures
compiler output, normalizes the tested source path to `<source>`, and compares
against `tests/diagnostics/baselines/<name>.txt`.

```pwsh
# Verify diagnostic baselines
pwsh ./scripts/run-diagnostics.ps1

# Refresh baselines after an intentional diagnostic wording change
pwsh ./scripts/run-diagnostics.ps1 -Update
```

Use small single-purpose inputs here: each file should exercise one diagnostic
path and fail before assembly or emulator stages are needed.

## Running the extended c-testsuite corpus

The c-testsuite single-exec submodule cases live under
`tests/extended-tests/tests/single-exec/`. Each case keeps the
upstream trio of files: `<id>.c`, `<id>.c.tags`, and `<id>.c.expected`.

Target-inapplicable cases are listed in
`tests/_extended_test_overrides.json`. These are tests whose
premise conflicts with dcc's CP/M 2.2/Z80 target model or documented C dialect
(for example `long long`, `double`, wide-character headers, GNU statement
expressions, or C99/C11 features that dcc intentionally does not provide). The
extended runner reports them as skipped instead of failures.

Use `scripts/runall-extended.ps1` to build those cases with the same dcc,
dccpeep, M80, dccrtlstrip, M80, and L80 pipeline as the main suite, then run the
resulting `.COM` files under `ntvcm` and compare stdout+stderr with the matching
`.expected` file.

```pwsh
# C89-tagged tests (default when no standard flag is supplied)
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C89

# C99 target-standard set; c89-tagged tests are included by c-testsuite rules
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C99

# C11 target-standard set; c89 and c99 tests are included by c-testsuite rules
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C11

# Every imported single-exec case, including any case without a standard tag
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -All

# Smoke-test one case
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C89 -Test 00001

# Bound each build pass and emulator run to 30 seconds
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C89 -RunTimeout 30

# Use an alternate skip file, or an empty/nonexistent one to run everything
pwsh ./scripts/runall-extended.ps1 -C89 -SkipFile tests/_extended_test_overrides.json
```

The runner defaults to `-Mode fast` and parallel execution, matching the main
`runall.ps1` runner's current default behavior. Use `-Mode nopeep`, `-Mode full`,
or `-Serial` when you need a different pass or easier debugging.

## Placeholders for volatile output

Some programs print values that legitimately change between builds or platforms
(timestamps, build dates, path separators). A baseline may embed **placeholder
tokens** for those parts; the harness matches them as patterns instead of
literal text. All expected content still lives in the single baseline file.

| Token      | Matches                                   | Example value |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `{{DATE}}` | C `__DATE__` value (`Mmm dd yyyy`)        | `Jun 16 2026` |
| `{{TIME}}` | C `__TIME__` value (`HH:MM:SS`)           | `20:13:03`    |
| `{{SEP}}`  | path separator (`/` on Unix, `\` Windows) | `/`           |

For example, `tests/baselines/tstdc.txt` (the `__DATE__`/`__TIME__`/`__FILE__`
macro test) uses:

```text
__DATE__ {{DATE}}
__TIME__ {{TIME}}
__FILE__ tests{{SEP}}tstdc.c
__LINE__ 8
__STDC__ 1
test tstdc completed with great success
```

A baseline with no placeholder tokens is compared as an exact string. The token
definitions are global (in `scripts/runall.ps1`); add a new one there if you
need to mask another kind of volatile value.

## Adding a new test

1. Add the program as `tests/<name>.c`.
2. If it needs arguments, a custom stack size, or should be skipped, add an
   entry to `tests/_test_overrides.json`.
3. Generate its baseline by capturing the **known-good** output into
   `tests/baselines/<name>.txt` (exact stdout, LF line endings, no extra
   trailing content). If any output is volatile (dates, times, paths), replace
   those parts with the placeholder tokens described above.
4. Run `pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1` and confirm the new test reports
   "Output matches baseline".

## Regenerating baselines from the legacy file

The baselines were originally derived from the single concatenated file
`baseline_test_dcc.txt` (output blocks separated by `test <app>` headers, in a
fixed run order). To (re)generate the per-app `baselines/` files from it:

```pwsh
pwsh ./scripts/convert-baseline.ps1
```

That converter slices the legacy file using the authoritative ordered app list
in `runall.sh` so that output lines which themselves begin with `test ` (e.g.
`test tstdc completed with great success`) are not mistaken for section
headers. The split reproduces the original baseline byte-for-byte.

## Notes for automated agents

- The **source of truth** for "what a test should print" is
  `tests/baselines/<name>.txt`. Do not infer expected output from the `.c`
  source alone.
- Keep the baseline and the test in sync: if you intentionally change a
  program's output, update its baseline file in the same change.
- Do not edit `baseline_test_dcc.txt` by hand to fix a single test; prefer
  editing the per-app baseline. The legacy file is kept only for historical
  reference and round-trip regeneration.
- Per-test run and build parameters (arguments, stack size, dcc flags, ignore)
  are configuration, and live in `tests/_test_overrides.json`, not encoded in
  the baselines.
