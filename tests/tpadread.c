/* tpadread.c - a partial (non-128-byte-aligned) write into virgin CP/M
 * territory - including the common case of a freshly created/truncated
 * file - pads the rest of that 128-byte record with Ctrl-Z (0x1A) via
 * dccrtl's __zerdm (DCCRTL.MAC), because the record has to be written in
 * full and there's no real "old data" to merge with yet. That padding is
 * genuine, on-disk, readable data: fread()/read() aren't bounded by the
 * C-level tracked length (__fdlen, what ftell()/SEEK_END report) - they
 * just return whatever BDOS's random-read call hands back. So a buffer-
 * sized fread() on a short file can return far more bytes than the file's
 * own reported length, all silently valid as far as fread()'s return count
 * is concerned.
 *
 * This is a real, known limitation - but deliberately NOT "fixed" at the
 * RTL level, and this test still documents the unfixed behavior rather
 * than asserting the theoretically-correct one. An earlier attempt made
 * __rdsz itself trim __fdlen to the exact byte count (scanning the last
 * record for trailing 0x1A, same idea as the append-mode fix in
 * __apseek) and bounded _read() by it. Both parts had to be reverted:
 * a single genuine trailing ^Z byte a program deliberately writes as
 * real text-file-EOF data (the classic CP/M convention - see fileops.c's
 * own cpm_filelen helper, which does exactly this scan itself on top of
 * the *un*trimmed length) is indistinguishable on disk from __zerdm's
 * unwritten-tail padding, so unconditionally trimming __fdlen silently
 * ate real data fileops.c's own test depends on seeing. __apseek's own
 * narrower trim (used only to position "a" mode's append point, never
 * touching the shared __fdlen) is where that idea actually landed safely.
