/* tstar.c - unlike '?', a literal '*' is not a BDOS-level wildcard at all.
 * CP/M 2.2's BDOS only ever treats '?' specially (see twild.c); '*' has no
 * meaning to BDOS itself - the shell-glob-style "*.C matches every .C file"
 * convenience is implemented by the CCP's own command-line parser (and by
 * virtually every historic CP/M C runtime library), which expands a '*' by
 * filling the rest of the current field with '?' before the FCB ever
 * reaches BDOS. dccrtl's __mkfcb now does the same: a '*' in the name or
 * extension fills the remainder of that field with '?'.
 *
 * Before this fix, __mkfcb copied a literal '*' byte straight into the FCB
 * unchanged. Since no real on-disk filename ever contains a literal '*'
 * byte, unlink("SA*.TMP") silently matched nothing and failed - confirmed
 * identically on ntvcm, tnylpo, and cpmemu. cpm.exe was the one outlier:
 * it actually deleted the matching files, almost certainly because it
 * resolves the pattern through a host Windows API that natively globs '*'
 * - meaning a C program relying on that would have silently worked on one
 * platform and nowhere else. Expanding '*' in __mkfcb itself makes the
 * behavior consistent everywhere DCCRTL runs, independent of whatever
 * wildcard conventions the underlying host/emulator does or doesn't have.
 *
 * Note: cpmemu turns out not to implement wildcard delete via BDOS fn 19
 * at all - not even the single-'?' case in twild.c passes there. That's a
 * pre-existing cpmemu limitation unrelated to this fix (nothing in DCCRTL
 * can work around another program's BDOS not honoring '?' the way the
 * spec requires), so it isn't asserted here; see the README's emulator
 * table for details.
