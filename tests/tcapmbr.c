 * tcapmbr.c - regression coverage for chained assignment through pointer

 *
 * A chained assignment through two dot-accessed pointer struct members
 * used to fail to compile with "error DCC-E1002: unsupported expression
 * statement" - plain int members or a single (non-chained) pointer
 * assignment both compile fine; it's specifically two pointer members of
 * the same struct instance assigned in one chained expression. Found via
 * SDCC's regression test gcc-torture-execute-20050125-1.c.
