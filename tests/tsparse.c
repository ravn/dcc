/* tsparse.c - seeking far past current end-of-file and writing a single
 * byte extends the file's *tracked* length (dccrtl's __extln, driven off
 * the write offset) immediately, but only the one 128-byte record actually
 * touched by that write goes through a real BDOS random-write call.
 * Earlier records the seek jumped over are never written at all, so
 * whether reading them back afterward returns zero bytes, Ctrl-Z-filled
 * bytes (what dccrtl's own partial-record fill uses - see __zerdm), or a
 * short read depends on allocation details this test doesn't control. This
 * doesn't assert a specific "correct" fill value - it reports the reported
 * length, what actually comes back from the gap, and confirms the one byte
 * that was actually written survives at the right offset, so behavior is
 * at least visible and comparable across emulators.
