/* tappend.c - fopen(path, "a") must position the stream at end-of-file
 * before the first write, per C89 7.9.5.3: "the byte string is appended
 * to the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing contents".
 *
 * dccrtl's _open takes any O_CREAT flag (which "a" maps to, same as "w")
 * straight to its create path, which unconditionally deletes the existing
 * file (BDOS fn 19) and makes a fresh one (BDOS fn 22) - there is no check
 * for "does it already exist and should its content be kept". So "a" mode
 * is not just missing a seek-to-end: it destroys the prior content exactly
 * like "w" does.
 *
 * Reads back an exact byte count (not an oversized buffer) so this result
 * isn't muddied by the separate Ctrl-Z record-padding behavior tpadread.c
 * covers - a partial-record write pads the rest of that record and a
 * bigger read would pick that padding up too.
