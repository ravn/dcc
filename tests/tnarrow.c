 * the case that must narrow the array's storage to unsigned char and use a
 * matching (not doubled) address stride. Large enough that a stale,
 * word-sized address stride paired with byte-sized storage (the historical
 * bug this guards against) would write past the narrowed frame slot and
 * corrupt an adjacent local or the sum itself. Deliberately mirrors e.c's
 * own `for (n = N - 1; n > 0; --n) a[n] = ...;` shape - the array-narrowing
 * analysis in dcc_array_narrow.c only recognizes this decrementing/`>` -
 * guarded idiom for variable-indexed writes, not a plain `for (i = 0;
 * i < N; i++)` counter (see the memory/commit notes for this feature).
 * `a` must also be the LAST local declared in this scope: the speculative
 * re-parse used to prove safety starts right after its declarator and
 * can't handle a further declaration (only statements), so anything
 * declared after it forces an automatic (safe) decline. */
