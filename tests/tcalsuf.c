/*
 * tcalsuf.c - regression coverage for compound assignment of a long
 * literal to a narrow variable.
 *
 * A compound-assignment whose right-hand literal carries an 'L' suffix
 * used to fail to compile with "error DCC-E1002: unsupported expression
 * statement" when the left-hand side is a narrow (unsigned char)
 * variable - the identical assignment without the L suffix compiles
 * fine, so the literal's suffix (not the value or the narrow LHS alone)
 * is the trigger. Found via SDCC's regression test constmodifiers.c.
