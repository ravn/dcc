/* twild.c - dccrtl's __mkfcb copies filename characters verbatim (after
 * uppercasing) with no special-casing for '?' or '*'. CP/M's BDOS treats
 * those bytes in an FCB as wildcards for functions like delete (fn 19) and
 * rename (fn 23), so a literal '?'/'*' that reaches unlink()/rename() -
 * whether typed deliberately or arriving from unsanitized input - can
 * match and act on multiple files in one call instead of the single named
 * file the caller presumably intended. This proves it directly: create
 * three distinct files, unlink() one ambiguous pattern, and report which
 * of the three survive.
