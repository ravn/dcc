# DCCRTL.MAC deep audit — correctness & optimisation review

**Status: AUDIT ONLY.** No runtime code was changed to produce this report. This
is a findings/backlog document for a future, separate fix-implementation pass.

## Follow-up implementation status

The audit itself remains a read-only snapshot. Follow-up work on this branch has
implemented all eleven repair batches:

- Batch 1 fixed **SS-C1**, **SH-F1**, **CT-F1**, **SJ-F1**, and **EC-F1**.
- Batch 2 fixed add/sub subnormal handling, nearest-even rounding, conversion
  rounding, and the `nextafterf()` infinity edge from **FC-F2/FC-F3**.
- Batch 3 fixed **PF-F1** through **PF-F10** and **SJ-F2** through **SJ-F5**,
  plus stale scanner documentation **SJ-F7**. File-backed formatted output now
  streams in 128-byte CP/M-record chunks, and the new state remains isolated in
  a `dccrtlstrip` block used only by `fprintf`/`vfprintf`.
- Batch 4 fixed **CI-2** through **CI-5**, **CT-F3**, and **CT-F4** by giving
  each stream one shared pushback byte, consuming it through all read paths,
  clearing EOF on success, and clearing stale state on open, close, and seek.
  Full-width stream validation prevents wide `FILE *` values from aliasing
  another descriptor's pushback, and a pushed-back Ctrl-Z remains guaranteed
  input rather than being reinterpreted as fresh text EOF.
- Batch 5 fixed the actionable parts of **FI-2** through **FI-12**, **CT-F2**,
  **CT-F5** through **CT-F13**, and **CT-F15** through **CT-F19**. The runtime
  now retains read/write/append/binary modes in the existing descriptor-state
  byte, validates full-width descriptors and positions, implements strict
  `fopen` modes and per-write append positioning, preserves partial-transfer
  semantics, loops `fread`/`fwrite` over the low-level `INT_MAX` limit, removes
  closed temporary files, checks `tmpnam` collisions, and enforces documented
  rename errors. The ctype helpers now reject out-of-range values, and
  `isgraph(expr)` evaluates its argument once.
- Batch 6 fixed **MT-F1** through **MT-F15**. `expf`, `powf`, trig,
  hyperbolic, `frexpf`, `ldexpf`, and `modff` now classify special values,
  signed zero, parity, subnormals, and range boundaries consistently. True
  domain/range exits report `EDOM`/`ERANGE` without misclassifying NaN
  propagation. The compact trig implementation deliberately returns NaN for
  finite `|x| >= 32768`; a code-heavy Payne-Hanek reducer was not added.
- Batch 7 fixed **CT-F14**, **MT-F16**, **EC-F11**, **CI-12**, **XM-O5**,
  **SM-F8**, and **SS-O4**, and accepted the non-regressing subset of
  **SM-F1**. Shared tmpfile constants, hyperbolic scratch, calendar helpers,
  pushback/file state, multibyte counters, and the divmod cache now live in
  their owning or shared strip blocks. Five fastcall entries use zero-byte
  `EQU` dependencies to share following cores without retaining unreachable
  general-call prologues, and `__q2u` is a true `D16U` alias. The `__chf`,
  `__rcf`, `__ssf`, and `__msf` reorderings remain rejected: canonical
  whole-program profiling showed that accepting the latter two with `__scf`
  shifted a hot heap-backed instruction stream across 256-byte boundaries,
  adding 446,945 nopeep cycles despite shrinking the COM. Complete divmod-cache
  removal also remains rejected because its measured cycle cost outweighed its
  size saving.
- Batch 8 integrated five independently measured slices:
  - Heap/console accepted **SH-F2** through **SH-F4**, **CI-10**, **CI-11**,
    **CI-13**, and **CI-14**. Heap wrappers now tail-transfer, `calloc` avoids
    its IX frame and unreachable zero-fill counts, allocator walks keep live
    values in registers, console output avoids redundant saves and empty-reset
    writes, BIOS dispatch uses an 8-bit documented-function offset, and
    one-byte file I/O discards arguments with caller-saved pops. **SH-F5**
    remains rejected: predecessor growth added 120 exact bytes (128 linked COM
    bytes) to every realloc runtime for only 9,076 cycles across 200 ordinary
    operations.
  - Formatted/file I/O accepted the remaining live part of **PF-O1**, plus
    **PF-O2**, **FI-13**, and the remaining live sites from **CT-F20**.
    **PF-O1**'s `pf_print_u32`, **FI-14**, and the `_fread`/`_fwrite` portions
    of **CT-F20** were already absent or optimized at the base. **SJ-F6**
    remains rejected because its split scanner loops added 32 exact runtime
    bytes and grew the nopeep scanner COM by 128 bytes.
  - String/sort accepted **SM-F3** through **SM-F7** and **SS-O1**, **SS-O2**,
    **SS-O3**, **SS-O5**, **SS-O6**, **SS-O7**, and **SS-O8**. The `-Os`
    frame and helper thresholds include retained runtime-body costs. No
    neutral or regressive SM/SS variant was retained: the one/two-frame and
    zero-net helper cases remain rejected by their measured cost gates.
  - Arithmetic/float accepted **LA-F2** through **LA-F8**, **FC-F6**,
    **FC-F7**, and **MT-F18**; **MT-F17** was already fixed at the base.
    AST-time type repair, 16-bit div/mod repair, and fusion across calls remain
    rejected; pairing is 32-bit-only, same-block, and no-call. LA-F2's
    post-promotion repair now preserves the effective type of a direct
    equal-width 32-bit cast on either operand before representation-identity
    casts are removed. This prevents `(unsigned long)a / b` and the matching
    modulo/fused forms from reverting to signed helpers, while signed casts of
    unsigned high-bit operands continue to select signed helpers.
  - Exec/calendar accepted **XM-O1** through **XM-O4** and **EC-F12**.
    **EC-F13** was rejected in that batch because its direct asctime formatter
    added 193 runtime bytes and 256 COM bytes when `sprintf()` was independently
    retained; Batch 11 later superseded that experiment with the smaller
    range-checked fixed-layout implementation required by **EC-F10**.
  - The reviewed 41-byte gap after `__stchk` was removed completely. Emulator
    address alignment is not a valid Z80 optimization, and the gap added 34
    exact stripped bytes to ordinary stack-checked applications. Revised
    cumulative measurements use the naturally linked runtime layout only;
    address placement is not a production or performance-selection gate.
    Two structural cycle improvements replace the gap: the proven byte-sieve
    marking schedule now makes its common in-range path fall through and uses
    one no-carry loop branch, while `__mulu` executes a fully unrolled
    four-iteration path when the selected multiplier fits in a nibble. The
    latter adds useful executable code rather than unreachable bytes and
    improves every linked multiplication probe measured.
  - With no alignment bytes, exact stack-checked base-to-revised deltas are:
    sieve `-864,232/-1,800,362` cycles (peep/nopeep), `-43` RTLMIN bytes,
    and `-128/-128` COM bytes; pint `-4,849,430/-4,845,060` cycles,
    `-32` RTLMIN bytes, and `0/-128` COM bytes; cobint
    `-9,695,077/-9,238,205` cycles, `-36` RTLMIN bytes, and `0/-128`
    COM bytes. The unchanged-app-MAC pint/cobint results also confirm that the
    linked runtime improvement, not application-specific selection, supplies
    their recovery.
- Batch 9 fixed **CI-1**, **CI-6**, **CI-8**, and **CI-9**, supplied the
  compatible `biosreg(fn,bcarg,dearg)` extension for **CI-7**, accepted
  **SM-F2** and **LA-F1**, and documented **LA-F9**. Startup now bounds the
  complete 127-byte CP/M command tail, rejects wrapped startup scratch before
  heap-limit acceptance, and `_setvbuf` and `_strerror` validate their full
  16-bit inputs. The ordinary 16/32-bit signed/unsigned divide helpers use the
  same deterministic zero-divisor pair; specialized fused `__m1mu` documents
  its 16-bit `low16(a*b)` dividend sentinel.
  `bios()`/`bioshl()` retain their existing ABI, and `LONG_MIN/-1` remains
  documented undefined C behavior with the runtime's two's-complement result.
- Batch 10 fixed **XM-C1** through **XM-C4** and **XM-R1** through
  **XM-R3**. The conversion slice fixed **XM-C1**, **XM-C2**, and **XM-C3**:
  `strtol`/`strtoul` now recognize `0x` only when a hexadecimal digit follows,
  so bare/incomplete prefixes convert the leading zero and report the exact
  endpoint without manufacturing `ERANGE`. The fixed single-byte execution
  encoding now rejects nonzero `wchar_t` high bytes: `wctomb` writes nothing
  and returns `-1`, while `wcstombs` returns `(size_t)-1` without storing a
  truncated offending byte. The latter uses no static counter and preserves
  the 16-bit `size_t` count model. Exec producers stage and accept the full
  127-byte CP/M payload, reject a 128th byte with `E2BIG`, and omit CR only
  when byte `00FFh` is payload. `execv` rejects empty or delimiter-containing
  arguments with `EINVAL` while direct CP/M quote and backslash bytes remain
  literal. Exec path construction accepts only an unambiguous CP/M 8.3 name
  with an optional A: through P: prefix; default FCBs use startup's complete
  byte-`<=20h` delimiter rule. Before replacing the caller's stack, the loader
  uses BDOS function 35 to approve an exact record count and layout below the
  16-byte stack gap, 36-byte FCB, and 44-byte exact-count trampoline.
- Batch 11 fixed **EC-F2** through **EC-F10** and **EC-F13**.
  `mktime()` now normalizes month/date/clock fields into a checked day/second
  pair before applying the 1970 and signed-2038 range limits, never mutates a
  rejected input, cannot accept a post-2106 modulo-2^32 wrap, and restores the
  shared `gmtime`/`localtime` result after breaking down an unrelated caller
  object. `time()` validates BDOS packed BCD and the CP/M-day cutoff before
  constructing its signed `time_t`. `difftime()` detects signed subtraction
  overflow and converts the exact unsigned magnitude before applying the
  result sign.
  `asctime()` validates every table index and numeric field before directly
  emitting its fixed 26-byte layout, so invalid inputs leave the static buffer
  untouched. The direct layout also resolves **EC-F13** without retaining
  `sprintf()`. `atof`/`strtod` now combine large explicit exponents with
  fractional and skipped-integer digit counts before applying float-range
  bounds, preserving large exact cancellations. `strtod` sets `ERANGE` only
  for numeric overflow/underflow, not explicit infinity/NaN or exact zero.
  `atoi`/`atol` skip all C89 whitespace bytes without retaining unrelated
  conversion blocks. `strftime()` is a bounded fixed-C-locale formatter
  covering every C89 conversion available from `struct tm`, plus the
  documented `%C` century extension. It rejects malformed formats and invalid
  fields deterministically, preserves NUL termination at every positive bound,
  and remains a self-contained `dccrtlstrip` block that does not retain the
  calendar core or `mktime`.
  Final review leaves the strftime-only replacement at 968 exact bytes, only
  five bytes above the prior 963-byte integration while adding `%C`; the
  original supplied implementation cost 1,042 bytes. The full runtime grows by
  1,191 exact bytes: calendar/time +98, conversion/errno +125, and strftime
  +968. Isolated and combined RTLMIN probes are exactly additive, confirming
  that strftime does not acquire calendar-core ownership.

**Overall repair status: 11/11 batches complete.** The remaining limitations
are deliberate target or measured-size decisions, not unintegrated audit work:

- **PF-F11** remains deferred because defensive NULL `%s` handling would add
  cost to every valid `%s` call.
- Subnormal multiply/divide/square-root work from **FC-F2** remains open because
  the correct designs measured so far add too much linked code for the target.
- **FI-1** remains excluded because an 8 MiB CP/M file is outside this target's
  practical media limits. **FI-9** remains limited by the absence of a universal
  CP/M 2.2 metadata-flush service.
- `freopen` cannot preserve the numeric identity of
  `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` without replacing the runtime's numeric `FILE *`
  ABI.
- Calendar time remains a signed 32-bit, timezone-free model: `time()` depends
  on optional BDOS function 105, the representable range ends at
  2038-01-19 03:14:07, and `strftime()` deliberately uses only the fixed C
  locale with an empty `%Z`.
- DCC has no distinct `double`; `atof`, `strtod`, and `difftime` therefore use
  the target's single-precision `float`.

The completed 11/11 state passes both strict full+extended suites: 410
applications found, 400 passed, 10 intentionally skipped, and zero failed in
both stack-check and no-stack modes. Runtime coverage reconciles all 408 public
labels and all 196 standard app-callable APIs.

## Scope & method

- Target: `DCCRTL.MAC` (24,092 lines, 407 public labels), the single
  hand-maintained Z80/CP-M-80 C runtime for `dcc`. Per-app `RTLMIN.MAC` is
  generated by `dccrtlstrip` at link time and was out of scope (never
  hand-edited).
- The file was partitioned into 13 functionally-coherent, non-overlapping
  sections and each was reviewed independently, in parallel, **read-only**, by
  a `gpt-5.6-sol` sub-agent with full context on the runtime ABI, the
  `dccrtlstrip` public-label block-splitting mechanism, and the three prior
  runtime audit docs (`archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md`,
  `archive/runtime-performance-optimisation.md`,
  `archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md`), so as not to re-report
  already-fixed or already-documented/deferred issues.
- Every finding below is attributed to its section and carries the
  sub-agent's confidence rating. Several of the most severe findings were
  independently spot-verified by the orchestrating session against the actual
  current source (see the subnormal-add trace under finding **FC-F2**).
- No file, other than this report, was modified. No build or regression run
  was performed as part of this audit; **every fix arising from this backlog
  must still pass the project's normal gate**: the full regression suite
  bit-exact against `tests/baselines/*.txt` in both `peep` and `nopeep` modes,
  and, for optimisations, a measured `ntvcm -p` cycle count plus size
  comparison before/after (line/instruction count alone does not prove a
  win).

## Baseline tooling check (run before the section audits)

- `python3 scripts/rtl-iy-safety.py` → **PASS**. IY references remain confined
  to the three audited paths (`__extln`, `_setjmp`/`_longjmp`).
- `python3 scripts/audit-runtime-coverage.py` → **FAIL (exit 1)**. 17 public
  labels are "UNEXPECTED (unaccounted)": `_dcc_nan` (a data symbol, line
  13176) and 16 real formatted-I/O label variants that the script's static
  `FMT_PUBLIC`/`FMT_FUNCS` lists don't know about: the float-only ("fio")
  variants `_fpfio,_snfio,_spfio,_vffio,_vnfio,_vpfio,_vsfio` and the
  float+long ("lio") variants `_fplio,_snlio,_splio,_vflio,_vnlio,_vplio,_vslio`
  for `sprintf/fprintf/vprintf/vsprintf/vfprintf/snprintf/vsnprintf`, plus the
  long-only `_snlng`/`_vnlng` for `snprintf`/`vsnprintf`. **This is a tooling
  gap** (the script drifted out of sync as the runtime grew these variants),
  not proof of a runtime bug — but see the "Coverage of the 16 tooling-gap
  labels" note under **Section 5** below: the printf-engine section agent
  additionally determined that 5 of these 16 labels
  (`_vpfio,_vsfio,_vffio,_vnfio,_vnlng`) appear **untested** by the default
  Linux `runall.ps1`/`ma.sh` path because it never emits the negative
  `-fno-*io` flags that would exercise them, so this is not purely cosmetic.
  Recommended fix: update `scripts/audit-runtime-coverage.py`'s label lists to
  include all current variants (restores the guardrail), and separately
  decide whether the 5 untested labels need dedicated test coverage.

## READ THIS FIRST — highest-severity findings across the whole runtime

These are the items with the most severe, concrete, verified impact,
independent of which section found them. Full detail, exact lines, and
suggested direction for each are in the per-section lists below (find them by
their bold tag, e.g. **FC-F2**, **PF-F1**).

1. **[Float core] Subnormal float arithmetic is catastrophically broken**
   across add/mul/div/scale/sqrt. `1.4e-45f + 1.4e-45f` (the two smallest
   positive subnormals) returns `1.6e32f` (raw `0x75000000`) instead of
   `2.8e-45f` — independently re-traced and confirmed by this session (see
   **FC-F2**). Any program that produces or consumes subnormal floats gets
   silently, wildly wrong answers.
2. **[scanf] `sc_get_file` clobbers register B, breaking ALL literal-character
   matching** in `fscanf`/`scanf` reading from a file or console — e.g.
   `fscanf(fp,"A=%d",&v)` fails to match the literal `"A="`. This is in the
   very recently, fully-rewritten scanf core (see **SJ-F1**).
3. **[printf] `%f` field-width staging double-counts the emitted length**,
   corrupting the byte count passed to `_write` for non-console `fprintf` —
   real files get writes of garbage/OOB bytes (see **PF-F1**).
4. **[printf] The `%f` width scratch buffer (32 bytes) overflows for legal
   precisions ≥ 30**, corrupting adjacent formatter state (see **PF-F2**), and
   **[printf] non-console `fprintf`/`vfprintf` use an unbounded 256-byte
   static buffer** that overflows for any output ≥ 256 characters (see **PF-F3**).
5. **[ctype/stdio] `_fseek` discards `_lseek`'s actual result**, so most
   `fseek` failures are reported as success, and out-of-range `FILE*` values
   can write out of bounds into the `__fdeof` array (see **CT-F1**).
6. **[console I/O] `argv` overflows with ≥ 17 command-tail arguments**
   (corrupts `argv`/`__argbuf`) and is missing the required `argv[argc]=NULL`
   at exactly 16 (see **CI-1**).
7. **[Exit/calendar] `_strftime`'s `public` declaration and its function body
   sit in two different `dccrtlstrip` blocks** — any program that calls only
   `strftime()` (not `mktime()`) silently loses the body and fails to link
   (see **EC-F1**). This is exactly the class of stripper-boundary regression
   the review was asked to watch for.
8. **[Heap] `realloc` has a lost-carry bug on large top-of-heap growth**
   (e.g. growing to within 2 bytes of the 64K wrap) that corrupts `__brk` and
   accepts an impossible request instead of failing (see **SH-F1**).
9. **[Sort] `qsort`'s inner-loop backward walk can underflow a pointer**,
   feeding an invalid address to the user comparator and corrupting memory
   for certain size/count combinations (see **SS-C1**).
10. **[File I/O] `__rdsz` drops the FCB's third record-count byte**, so files
    ≥ 8 MiB report length 0 and mis-seek/append (see **FI-1**); **fd validation
    only checks the low byte of a 16-bit `int`**, so e.g. fd `0x0100` aliases
    stdin and `_close` doesn't verify the slot is even open (see **FI-2**).
11. **[ungetc/pushback — found from 3 angles]** `_ungetc` doesn't check for an
    already-pending pushback byte (a second `ungetc` silently destroys the
    first), never clears EOF on success, and pushback state outlives
    `close`/`fseek`/descriptor reuse; several read paths (console `fgets`,
    `gets`, real-file `fread`) don't honor pending pushback at all, and the
    scanner's own separate pushback isn't visible to stream-level pushback
    either (see **CI-2..CI-5**, **CT-F3..CT-F4**, **SJ-F3**).
12. **[Math] `powf`'s C99 special-value handling is extensively wrong**:
    negative base with a non-integer exponent should be NaN but returns 0;
    several NaN-table holes; sign of `±0` results lost; infinite exponents
    misclassified for negative bases (see **MT-F2..MT-F5**). **`tanf` returns 0
    at the rounded float π/2** instead of the correct huge value due to
    catastrophic-cancellation range reduction (see **MT-F6**).
13. **[exec] Multiple unbounded-copy buffer overflows** in the command-tail
    and path-construction helpers used by `exec`/`execv` (see **XM-C4**,
    **XM-R1**, **XM-R2**).
14. **[File I/O] `_open`'s `O_CREAT`/`O_TRUNC` low-level semantics are
    inverted/wrong**, and `_rename` doesn't enforce its documented
    wildcard-rejection or cross-drive (`EXDEV`) contract (see **FI-4**, **FI-10**).
15. **[stdio] `_fwrite` turns a write failure into either a huge (`0xffff`)
    or falsely-successful item count** (see **CT-F2**), and **`_mktime`
    accepts wrapped, unrepresentable post-2106 dates** instead of returning
    `-1` (see **EC-F2**).

## Section 1 — Startup + heap allocator + memory lifecycle

`DCCRTL.MAC:1-170` (`start:`) and `:9487-10184` (`_malloc/_calloc/_free/__real/__frcoal/__mlh/__lmd`).

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** the startup SP/heap-limit wraparound
check (lines ~64-74) is already wrap-safe; the BSS-zero loop is correct for
lengths 0/1/large; calloc overflow-checking, realloc free-path coalescing,
boundary-tag coalescing, in-place shrink/growth and `__brk` trimming are
already fixed per `archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md` /
`archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md`; the documented `0xffff`
odd-size round-to-zero realloc defect is fixed (lines 9605-9610; **SH-F1**
below is a distinct even-size bug); no routine here touches IY.

### Correctness

- **SH-F1 — Lost carry corrupts heap during large top-block `realloc`.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:9759-9764` (`rl_try_grow_top` in `__real`), corruption committed
  at 9773-9783. Confidence: high. The carry from `old_ptr + new_size` is
  overwritten by a following `add hl,FTRSIZE` before it's tested. For
  `realloc(p, 0xfffe)`: `p+0xfffe` wraps to `p-2` (sets carry), then `+2`
  (footer size) produces `p` with carry now clear — the wrap is missed, growth
  is wrongly accepted, `__brk` moves backward to `p`, and the footer address
  wraps onto the header, corrupting heap state while still returning
  non-NULL. **Fix direction:** test carry immediately after both additions
  (as the sibling `mh_extend` path does), before comparing against
  `__hlimit`; keep `rl_do_alloc` as the fallback. Add a focused
  `realloc(p,65534U)` regression checking NULL-or-unchanged-old-contents plus
  subsequent allocator integrity.

### Optimisation

- **SH-F2 — `_malloc`/`_free` can tail-transfer instead of call+return.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:9500-9504` / `9839-9843`. Confidence: high. Both wrappers
  restore the return address before `call helper; ret`; replacing with a tail
  `jp`/`jr` lets the helper's own `ret` return directly to the C caller.
  `dccrtlstrip` reachability is unaffected (it recognizes JP/JR references).
  **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on alloc/free-heavy loops, peep+nopeep, plus final
  `.COM` size.
- **SH-F3 — `calloc` has an avoidable IX frame and two impossible-to-hit count
  branches.** `DCCRTL.MAC:9539-9577`. Confidence: high. After a non-NULL
  `__mlh` return, `__ml_need` is always even and ≥ 2 (9970-9982), so the
  zero-count and count-one checks (9557-9565) can never fire; args can be read
  directly off the incoming stack, skipping the IX setup/epilogues entirely
  while naturally preserving the caller's IX. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` for
  success/zero-product/overflow/failure paths; code size.
- **SH-F4 — Avoidable static-memory spills in realloc/malloc walks.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:9652-9688`, `10010-10155`. Confidence: high. `__rl_hdr` is
  stored then immediately reloaded across instructions that don't touch HL
  (shrink and top-growth paths); `__rl_thdr` is reloaded at 9688 while HL
  still holds it; every visited free block writes `__ml_usiz` even though the
  too-small branch can reconstruct `user_size` from HL+DE already in hand.
  **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on free-list-scan/shrink/top-growth cases; malloc
  block and final `.COM` size.
- **SH-F5 — Realloc can't exploit a smaller free predecessor plus the current
  block.** `DCCRTL.MAC:9704-9797`. Confidence: medium. Growth only absorbs a
  *following* free block; a predecessor-plus-current combined extent large
  enough to satisfy the request is not tried, so a realloc that could succeed
  by shifting the block down instead fails or falls back to a slower path.
  **Fix direction:** after in-place paths fail, inspect the predecessor
  footer and, if the combined extent suffices, copy the data down and
  restamp. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p`, peak `__brk`, and near-limit success rate
  for this shape vs. normal realloc paths; code-size cost of `__real` growth.

---

## Section 2 — Low-level console/keyboard/BDOS/BIOS I/O + stream setup

`DCCRTL.MAC:171-1206`: `__build_argv`, `__conout`, `__pchr`/`__fpc`,
`_clearerr`, `_setbuf`/`_setvbuf`, `_strerror`, `__putc`/`__fgetc`/`__getc`,
`_ungetc`, `_remove`, `__gchr`/`__kbht`/`__gtch`, `_bdos`/`_bdoshl`,
`_bios`/`_bioshl`, `_inp`/`_outp`.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `_clearerr`/`ferror` fixes and the
deliberate read-side EOF/error ambiguity are already documented and fixed
(`archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md:39-60`); real-file `setvbuf`
no-op behavior and the shared stdout/stderr console buffer are intentional,
documented behavior; `_remove`'s alias to `_unlink` (incl. wildcard deletion)
is a documented CP/M deviation, not a bug; the BDOS-fn-6 pending-byte design
in `__kbht`/`__gtch` (including its NUL limitation) is deliberate and
documented; `_strerror` covers every errno the runtime actually generates
plus `EDOM`/`ERANGE` — omitted messages for other declared-but-unused errno
constants is not treated as a defect; no routine here touches IY.

### Correctness

- **CI-1 — fixed in Batch 9.** `argv` now reserves 66 16-bit entries (64
  maximum tail arguments, `argv[0]`, and NULL), and `__build_argv` explicitly
  writes the terminator for empty through maximum-capacity tails. Length bytes
  above CP/M's valid 127-byte maximum are deterministically clamped to 127.
  Startup rejects unsigned `__hstart < __bsse` before heap-limit acceptance,
  so the compiler's `__bsse+260` scratch expression cannot wrap to a falsely
  acceptable low heap start.
- **CI-2 — A second successful `ungetc` destroys the first pending byte.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:807-846` (`_ungetc`). Confidence: high. `_ungetc` never checks
  `__ugv[fd]` before overwriting `__ugc[fd]`; two successive successful
  `ungetc` calls silently lose the first byte instead of the second call
  failing. **Fix direction:** check the valid flag first; return `EOF` without
  modifying existing state when already occupied.
- **CI-3 — Successful `ungetc` does not clear EOF.** `DCCRTL.MAC:768-786`
  (`__fgetc` sets `__fdeof`), `:829-841` (`_ungetc` doesn't clear it).
  Confidence: high. After reading EOF then successfully pushing a byte back,
  `feof()` remains true; worse, `fgets` (`:10450-10459`) rejects the stream
  before even checking pushback. **Fix direction:** clear the slot's
  `__fdeof` on a successful real-stream pushback.
- **CI-4 — Pushback survives seek and descriptor reuse.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:793-796` (`__ugv`/`__ugc`). Confidence: high. Nothing clears
  these arrays on close/reopen or successful `fseek` (`:11629-11640`), so a
  stale pushed-back byte can resurface on an unrelated later stream that
  reuses the same fd slot, or survive a seek that must discard it. **Fix
  direction:** clear the slot on descriptor allocation/close and on
  successful `fseek`/`rewind`/`freopen`; consider moving pushback state to its
  own block to avoid new `dccrtlstrip` coupling.
- **CI-5 — Several read paths don't honor pending pushback at all.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:793-846`, console `fgets` path `:10566-10584`, `_fread`
  `:11439-11447`. Confidence: high. `ungetc` on stdin bypasses console
  `fgets`/`gets` entirely (they call BDOS directly); `fgetc`→`ungetc`→`fread`
  skips the pushed byte and returns the *next* one instead; a pushed-back
  `0x1A` is treated by real-file `fgets` as physical EOF. **Fix direction:**
  centralize pushback consumption in one shared stream-read helper used by
  every read entry point. *(Independently confirmed/refined from the
  ctype/stdio section — see CT-F3.)*
- **CI-6 — fixed in Batch 9.** `_setvbuf` rejects a nonzero high byte before
  dispatching the low-byte `_IOFBF`/`_IOLBF`/`_IONBF` modes; rejected aliases
  return `-1` with `EINVAL`.
- **CI-7 — fixed compatibly in Batch 9.** Existing two-argument
  `bios()`/`bioshl()` source, function-pointer, and linked stack ABIs are
  unchanged. New `biosreg(fn,bcarg,dearg)` independently loads BC and DE,
  dispatches through the BIOS table, and returns HL for practical SECTRAN and
  CP/M 3 SELDSK-class forms.
- **CI-8 — fixed in Batch 9.** Both parser states now recognize space and tab
  delimiters, including leading and repeated mixtures.
- **CI-9 — fixed in Batch 9.** `_strerror` rejects any nonzero high byte before
  entering its compact low-byte dispatch. Supported positive errno values keep
  their existing messages; wide and negative aliases return the existing
  deterministic `"Error"` fallback.

### Optimisation

- **CI-10 — Redundant register saves in the hottest `__conout` path.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:283-311`. Confidence: high. `__conout` pushes/pops `BC/DE/HL`
  even though the callees it uses (`__cob_put`, `__cflush`) already preserve
  them; ~6 bytes / 63 T-states removable per character — and `__conout` is in
  every program's always-present baseline. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on fixed
  buffered-output workloads; linked `.COM` size.
- **CI-11 — Empty `__cflush` needlessly rewrites an already-zero count.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:349-405`. Confidence: high. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` for
  repeated empty flushes; linked size.
- **CI-12 — Pushback data placement drags file-I/O into `getchar`-only
  programs.** `DCCRTL.MAC:708-869`. Confidence: high. `__ugv`/`__ugc` are
  private to the `__fgetc` public block, so `__gchr` (used by plain
  `getchar`) retains all of `__fgetc`, which calls `_read` and pulls in the
  whole file-I/O core. **Fix direction:** split pushback state into its own
  small public block (`dccrtlstrip`-boundary change — verify reachability).
  **Measure:** `getchar`-only `.COM` size; `ntvcm -p` unaffected.
- **CI-13 — BIOS dispatch table-offset math is wider than it needs to be.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:1132-1139`. Confidence: high. Documented BIOS functions fit in
  8 bits; an 8-bit `3*fn` computation replaces the current 16-bit HL/BC
  sequence (~25 T-states / 3 bytes saved). **Measure:** tight BIOS-status-loop
  `ntvcm -p`; code size.
- **CI-14 — Expensive 3-word stack discard after 1-byte file I/O.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:462-467`, `748-752` (`__fpc`, `__fgetc`). Confidence: high.
  `ex de,hl` + `HL=6;add hl,sp;ld sp,hl` can be three `pop de` (smaller,
  faster, and legal since `DE` is caller-saved). **Measure:** cached
  per-character file read/write `ntvcm -p`; linked size.

## Section 3 — `string.h`/`mem*` primitives + integer multiply/divide core

`DCCRTL.MAC:1207-2708`: `__slen`..`__mset` (strlen/strcpy/strcmp/strcat/
strspn/strdup/memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp family) plus
`__mulu`/`__udivmod`/`__divu`/`__modu`/`__divs`/`__mods`/`__sdivmod`.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `memmove` overlap-direction (`LDDR`
backward path), bounded division, the `__mulu` small-operand path, and
`strcspn`/`strspn` counter removal are already fixed
(`archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md:86-115`); `memchr`'s `CPIR`
optimisation is already applied (`archive/runtime-performance-optimisation.md:229-240`);
static-scratch/cache non-reentrancy is an accepted, documented model-wide
limitation, not a new finding; overlap direction, zero-length ops, string
termination, `strdup` allocation-failure propagation, `INT_MIN` sign
correction, zero remainders, stack balance and IY preservation were all
individually verified correct. **No defined-input correctness defect was
found in this section** beyond the divide-by-zero sentinel inconsistency
below.

### Robustness

- **SM-F2 — accepted in Batch 9.** Signed 16-bit standalone and fused paths
  detect zero before negative-dividend normalization, preserving the same
  `0xffff` quotient and original-dividend remainder used by unsigned helpers.
  C still leaves division by zero undefined.

### Optimisation

- **SM-F1 — Fastcall entry blocks retain unreachable general-call
  prologues.** `DCCRTL.MAC:1239-2276` (`__scf`,`__icf`,`__rcf`,`__chf`,
  `__ssf`,`__mhf`,`__cmpf`,`__mcf`,`__msf`). Confidence: high. Each fastcall
  block jumps into a private core inside the *following* general-call public
  block, so `dccrtlstrip` also retains that general-call prologue even though
  it's unreachable from the fastcall entry (direct calls use the fast
  entries — see `dcc_ast_gen_expr.c:4385-4659`). **Fix direction:** reorder
  like `__slen`/`__slf` (general entry first, explicit jump into a following
  fast/core block) — this is a `public`-block-order change; verify
  `dccrtlstrip` reachability and function-pointer call sites. **Measure:**
  `ntvcm -p` for direct and function-pointer calls; per-symbol retained size.
- **SM-F3 — `strncpy` padding uses a scalar loop instead of `LDIR` off the
  already-copied NUL.** `DCCRTL.MAC:1975-1984`. Confidence: high. Also a dead
  `xor a` (overwritten before use). **Fix direction:** after guarding
  `BC==0`, set `HL=DE-1` and `LDIR` the existing NUL through the remaining
  destination. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` for zero/one-byte/long padding; size.
- **SM-F4 — Branchless sign-extension is available for 4 comparison
  tails.** `DCCRTL.MAC:1300-2085` (`__scmp`,`__sicm`,`__ncmp`,`__mcmp`).
  Confidence: high. `sbc a,a / ld h,a` replaces a branchy `ld h,0 / ret nc /
  ld h,0ffh`, preserving the exact -255..255 result. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p`
  both mismatch orderings; block sizes.
- **SM-F5 — `strxfrm` scans the copied prefix twice.** `DCCRTL.MAC:1730-1762`.
  Confidence: medium. For `n>0` it fully scans `s2` for length, then rescans
  the copied prefix. **Fix direction:** single walk, copying while capacity
  remains then continuing a length-only scan. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` for
  n=0/truncation/exact-fit/excess; code/data size.
- **SM-F6 — Set-membership scans (`strcspn`/`strpbrk`/`strspn`) reload the
  invariant source byte every inner iteration.** `DCCRTL.MAC:1774-1880`.
  Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** cache the outer source char once in
  `C`; keep an explicit empty-set fast path. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` across
  set lengths 0/1/many; block sizes.
- **SM-F7 — Ten signed-negation sites use a costlier idiom than the one
  already used elsewhere.** `DCCRTL.MAC:2551-2702` (`__divs`,`__mods`,
  `__sdivmod`). Confidence: high. `sbc a,a / sub h` (already used in `_abs`)
  is cheaper than `ld a,0 / sbc a,h`. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` all sign
  combinations incl. `INT_MIN`/exact-zero remainder; block size.
- **SM-F8 — Fused-divmod's 9-byte result cache lives inside `__udivmod`'s
  block, so direct fused-only callers retain it unused.** `DCCRTL.MAC:2353-2428`.
  Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** move the cache to a dedicated block
  referenced only by `__divu`/`__modu` (new public-block boundary). **Measure:**
  unchanged `ntvcm -p` after the move; fused-only `.COM` size; separately,
  profile whether the cache is still worthwhile now that compiler fusion
  catches proven pairs.

---

## Section 4 — Sort/search/abs/div + compiler codegen frame stubs

`DCCRTL.MAC:2709-3725`: `_abs`,`_labs`,`_div`,`_ldiv`,`_bsearch`,`_qsort`,
`__r1u/__r1s/__r1p/__q1p/__q2u/__r2u/__q2s/__r2s`, and the **extremely
hot** compiler codegen stubs `__en0/__entr/__lve/__la1-3/__lv1-8/__sv1-6/
__phix/__ldwl/__wand/__icmp/__sxde/__sxhl` used in essentially every
generated function's prologue/epilogue/load/store sequences.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `qsort`/`bsearch` non-reentrancy is
explicitly accepted (`archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md:240-243`);
`abs(INT_MIN)`/`labs(LONG_MIN)` signed-division semantics are documented
(`archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md:216-220`); the bounded `D16U`
fallback and qsort's alternate-AF swap are already-documented optimisations;
`_ldiv` already avoids a second division via `__ldv_rem_*` reuse; the
6-character external-name limitation on default `_bsearch` naming is a known
toolchain limitation.

### Correctness

- **SS-C1 — `qsort`'s backward walk can underflow a pointer, corrupting
  memory via the user comparator.** `DCCRTL.MAC:3061-3076` (`qs_inner`).
  Confidence: high. `pj-gapb` can wrap below the array base, but the carry
  is discarded before the `pprev<base` test. Example: `base=0x1000, size=2,
  num=4098` — after a swap at `pj=0x2002`, the next `pj=0x1000`; subtracting
  `gapb=0x1002` yields `0xFFFE` *with carry*, which the unsigned compare
  then treats as `>= base`, so the comparator is invoked on an invalid
  pointer and the subsequent swap can corrupt memory. **Fix direction:**
  branch to `qs_idone` on carry immediately after `sbc hl,de` (this also
  makes a later `or a` redundant), or restore integer `j`-index tracking.
  Add a low-address/large-gap regression.
- **SS-C2 — `bsearch`'s declared return type doesn't match the C standard.**
  `stdlib.h:69` vs. `DCCRTL.MAC:2884`. Confidence: high. C requires `void
  *bsearch(...)`; the header declares `const void *`, which rejects/warns on
  valid assignment to a writable element pointer (the ABI itself is fine —
  HL already returns the raw pointer). **Fix direction:** change the header
  declaration/doc to `void *`; no runtime change needed.

### Optimisation

*(These stubs are the hottest code in the runtime — even a 1-cycle change
multiplies across nearly every call/return in every program.)*

- **SS-O1 — `__en0` can `pop hl` directly instead of `pop de`+`ex de,hl`.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:3524-3530`. Confidence: high. DE's incoming value is discarded
  and DE is caller-saved. Saves 1 byte / 4 T-states on **every** `__en0`
  entry. **Measure:** linked size and `ntvcm -p` on call-heavy programs.
- **SS-O2 — `_div` should call the already-fused `__sdivmod` once instead of
  `__divs` then `__mods`.** `DCCRTL.MAC:2767-2795`. Confidence: high. Removes
  reload/sign-wrapper/cache-check overhead and lets `dccrtlstrip` drop
  `__divs`/`__mods` when otherwise unused. **Measure:** `_div`-only linked
  size; division microbenchmark cycles.
- **SS-O3 — The frame-stub peephole rewrite pass can *increase* output size
  at current thresholds.** `DCCRTL.MAC:3519-3554`;
  `src/dccpeep/peep_pass_stubs.c:37-123`. Confidence: high. Measured cases
  show some rewrites growing a function by up to 9 bytes and adding ~45
  T-states per invocation without accounting for the one-time helper-body
  cost. **Fix direction:** count local/no-local functions first and apply a
  whole-program cost model including the shared `__lve`. **Measure:** exact
  linked bytes and `ntvcm -p` for synthetic 1-3-framed-function programs.
- **SS-O4 — `__q2u` carries an unneeded call/return layer; making it an
  alias immediately before `D16U` would remove it entirely.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:3356-3412`. Confidence: high. `call D16U/ret` → `jp D16U` saves
  1 byte/17 T-states per quotient; the full alias form **moves a public
  entry label** and needs `dccrtlstrip` re-validation. **Measure:** constant
  unsigned-division loops; linked size.
- **SS-O5 — `_ldiv` reloads and re-walks its result pointer unnecessarily.**
  `DCCRTL.MAC:2822-2865`. Confidence: high. BC already equals `result+3`
  after storing the quotient and is untouched by the remainder-sign fixup;
  the reload+4×`inc` can become one `inc bc`. Saves ~9 bytes/56 T-states per
  call. **Measure:** `_ldiv` linked size; `tstdlib` cycles.
- **SS-O6 — `__r1s` redundantly saves/restores BC that it never modifies**
  (the callee `__r1u` already saves/restores it). `DCCRTL.MAC:3229-3248`.
  Confidence: high. **Measure:** negative-modulo-constant microbenchmark;
  linked size.
- **SS-O7 — Three peephole-stub rewrite thresholds (`__ldwl`,`__sxde`,
  `__sxhl`) permit zero-net-size rewrites that still cost cycles per site.**
  `src/dccpeep/peep_pass_stubs.c:353-480`; `DCCRTL.MAC:3668-3724`. Confidence:
  high. **Fix direction:** raise the minimum-site thresholds (suggested 6/4/6
  respectively) unless whole-program analysis proves the helper is already
  included. **Measure:** exact-threshold synthetic cases; linked bytes and
  cycles.
- **SS-O8 — A cheaper terminal 16-bit negation idiom (already used
  elsewhere in `__q1p`) is reusable in 3 more places.** `__r1s`, `__q2s`,
  `__r2s` (`DCCRTL.MAC:3237-3506`). Confidence: medium. `sbc a,a/sub h` saves
  1 byte/3 T-states per negation where outgoing carry is dead. **Measure:**
  signed constant divide/modulo cycles, size, both regression modes.

---

## Section 5 — `printf` engine, all variants

`DCCRTL.MAC:3726-5641` (engine core `_printf`/`__pf_run`/`pf_*`, `__pf32h`,
the float/long/float+long variant families and their many sibling labels)
and `:10684-11049` (`_sprintf`/`_snprintf`/`_fprintf`/`v*` family/`_puts`).
This is the largest, most complex section (~2900 lines); the sub-agent
prioritized the shared engine core and float/long dispatch over the thin
wrappers and reported no sub-range as only-skimmed.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `pf_div10`, `pf_build_u`,
`pf_divu32_10` are already-fixed prior optimisations
(`archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md:65-84`); the unsupported
`+`/space/`#`/`*`-width/`%e`/`%g`/`%p`/`%n` surface and `%lo` are documented
known-absent features, not defects (**PF-F7** below is specifically about
unsafe *cursor desynchronization* from the missing space-flag no-op, which
is a new, distinct issue from "space isn't implemented"); precision ≥ 10
float-rounding limitation is explicitly already flagged in-file
(`DCCRTL.MAC:4954-4956`); `INT_MIN`/`LONG_MIN`, unsigned decimal/hex/octal,
normal va-list offsets, `snprintf` n=0/1 capping, IX/IY preservation and
stack balance in the supported paths were all verified correct.

**Coverage of the 16 tooling-gap labels** (see the baseline check above):
the intent is full coverage via `tests/tpfio.c`, `tests/tplng.c`,
`tests/tpflio.c` plus `tests/_test_overrides.json`, but `scripts/runall.sh`
never translates a `false` override into an explicit `-fno-*io` flag, and a
non-literal format conservatively resolves to the combined "lio" path — so
under the default Linux `runall.ps1` path, **`_vpfio`, `_vsfio`, `_vffio`,
`_vnfio`, `_vnlng` appear untested** (the other 11 of the 16 do appear
exercised); a runner that emits explicit negative flags (e.g.
`runall-x64os.ps1`) does exercise all 16.

### Correctness

- **PF-F1 — `%f` field-width output is counted twice.** `pf_emit_a`
  (`:4341-4387`), `pf_f`/`pf_f_done` (`:4870-5168`). Confidence: high.
  Scratch-buffer emission increments the running char count, then padding
  and the real replay increment it *again*. `sprintf(buf,"%5.1f",1.0f)`
  returns `8` although `strlen(buf)==5`; for non-console `fprintf` this
  inflated count is handed straight to `_write`, which then reads/writes
  past the real text (including the NUL and stale bytes). **Fix direction:**
  snapshot/restore the count around scratch generation, or use a staging
  emitter that doesn't touch the logical output counter.
- **PF-F2 — `%f` width scratch buffer (32 bytes, `pf_fwbuf`) overflows for
  legal fixed precisions.** `:4870-5203`. Confidence: high. `%1.30f`
  produces exactly 32 content bytes and writes its NUL one past the buffer
  (over `pf_fl`); `%1.31f`+ overwrites live formatter state. **Fix
  direction:** replace with a counted/two-pass design or a verified bound
  check before writing — don't just enlarge the buffer without covering
  max precision across the full float range.
- **PF-F3 — Non-console `fprintf`/`vfprintf` format into a fixed 256-byte
  static buffer (`__pf_fbuf`) with no bound.** `:4718`, `:10783-10996`.
  Confidence: high. Exactly 256 formatted characters writes the NUL one
  byte out of bounds; longer output overwrites adjacent data/code. **Fix
  direction:** stream/chunk-flush to the file sink instead of formatting the
  whole result into one fixed buffer.
- **PF-F4 — `%ls` destroys the live character count.**
  `pf_ls`/`pf_wstrlen_hl` (`:5257-5299`). Confidence: high.
  `pf_wstrlen_hl` uses `C` as scratch without preserving the formatter's
  live count register, so `sprintf(buf,"%ls",L"A")` returns `2` for a
  1-byte result, and an empty wide string after other output can *reset*
  the running count. Its 8-bit internal length also wraps past 255 chars.
  **Fix direction:** preserve the live count register; track wide-string
  length independently as 16-bit/saturating.
- **PF-F5 — `%.Ns` scans past the permitted precision bound looking for a
  NUL.** `pf_s`/`pf__slen_hl` (`:4134-4426`). Confidence: high. A
  non-NUL-terminated N-byte buffer is a valid `"%.Ns"` argument, but the
  implementation does a full `strlen` *before* clamping to precision,
  reading beyond the valid object (even `"%.0s"` scans the whole string
  before emitting nothing). **Fix direction:** when precision is present, do
  a bounded scan of at most `pf_prec` bytes and use that directly.
- **PF-F6 — `%f` on finite values ≥ 2³² formats incorrectly.**
  `pf_f_rounded` (`:4996-5011`) via `__fful` (`:16781-16796`). Confidence:
  high. The integer part routes through unsigned-32-bit `__fful`, which
  saturates at exponent ≥159, so e.g. `4294967296.0f` begins from the
  saturated `4294967295` and the fractional-part subtraction is likewise
  wrong. **Fix direction:** extract the fixed-decimal integer part across
  the full finite IEEE-single range rather than through `unsigned long`.
- **PF-F7 — The unimplemented space flag desynchronizes the argument
  cursor** (unlike `+`/`#`, which are deliberately consumed as no-ops).
  `pf_pct_next` (`:3789-3830`); compiler mirror `dcc_asmname.c:280`.
  Confidence: high. `printf("% d %d",1,2)` emits the literal `" d"` without
  consuming the first argument, so the *second* conversion prints `1`
  instead of `2`; `"% f"` also fails to select the float variant since the
  compiler's format scanner likewise omits space. **Fix direction:** consume
  space as a no-op flag in both the runtime dispatcher and the compiler's
  format scanner.
- **PF-F8 — `%li` and `%lf` silently fail to consume their argument.**
  `pf_lng` (`:5240-5255`); selector `dcc_asmname.c:291-300`. Confidence:
  high. `pf_lng` only handles `d,u,x,X,s`; `%li` falls through and leaves the
  4-byte long unread (a later `%d` then consumes its low word instead);
  `%lf` is selected as needing both long+float support, but the long hook
  emits a literal `f` and never reads the float argument either. **Fix
  direction:** alias `i`→`pf_ld`; re-dispatch `f` through the float hook
  while preserving the advanced format pointer.
- **PF-F9 — Width and precision accumulate and store as a single byte,
  silently wrapping mod 256.** `:3845-3898`, `pf_width`/`pf_prec`
  (`:4653-4662`). Confidence: high. `%256d` becomes width 0; `%.256s`
  becomes explicit precision 0 (emits nothing); signed field-length
  arithmetic can also wrap when precision 255 + sign = length 256. **Fix
  direction:** use 16-bit width/precision/length counters, or explicitly
  reject/saturate overflow.
- **PF-F10 — `fprintf`/`vfprintf` ignore `_write`'s failure return.**
  `:10805-10996`; failure source `:7271-7284`. Confidence: high. `_write`
  returns `0xffff` on disk-full/bad-fd, but both wrappers discard it and
  return the positive formatted count regardless, violating the documented
  negative-on-error contract. **Fix direction:** propagate `_write`'s result;
  return negative on failure with a consistent partial-write policy.
- **PF-F11 — `%s` with a NULL pointer has no defensive handling.**
  `pf_s`/`pf__slen_hl` (`:4134-4426`). Confidence: high. A NULL `%s`
  argument scans from CP/M address zero, potentially emitting low-memory
  contents; NULL is outside the strict NUL-terminated-string contract so
  this is robustness rather than a conformance defect. **Fix direction:**
  optionally special-case NULL to emit a fixed placeholder such as
  `"(null)"`.

### Optimisation

- **PF-O1 — Two internal helpers end `call X / ret` and could tail-jump.**
  `pf_zfd_print` (`:4092-4094`), `pf_print_u32` (`:4831-4834`). Confidence:
  high. **Measure:** linked `.COM` size and `ntvcm -p` for integer/float
  printf-family workloads, peep+nopeep.
- **PF-O2 — `pf_hex_byte`/`pf_hex_nib` appear dead** (current hex builders
  use `pf_hex_nib_char`; a repo-wide reference search found no other
  callers). `:4575-4608`. Confidence: high. **Measure:** hex-using `.COM`
  size before/after removal; confirm `ntvcm -p` cycles unchanged.

## Section 6 — Low-level fd-based file I/O + FCB/DMA/sector-cache core

`DCCRTL.MAC:6663-8310`: `_open/_read/_write/_close/_unlink/_lseek/_fsync/
_fdatasync`, `__chkfd/__advio/__rdhit/__zerdm/__mkfcb`, `_rename`,
per-fd state arrays, `__fcbs`/`__dma`, and `_srand`/`_rand`.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `_clearerr`/`ferror`/`__fderr`
write-error tracking is already fixed
(`archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md:39-60`); the read-cache
miss-invalidation and open/close/write invalidation fixes are already
applied and the current cache-key logic is coherent
(`archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md:107-140`); record-rounded lengths,
readable `0x1A` padding, trailing-`0x1A` append ambiguity, and non-atomic
append are documented/deferred CP/M limitations
(`docs/docs/en/10-system-and-cpm.md:97-128,235-243`); the accepted risk of
unsupported-BDOS-fn-48 emulator termination was not duplicated (**FI-9**
below only concerns implementations where fn 48 *does* return);
`NFILES=8`/`UGC_MAX=11` and per-fd array dimensions are consistent;
`_srand`/`_rand` correctly implement the documented 16-bit xorshift.

### Correctness

- **FI-1 — `__rdsz` drops the FCB's third record-count byte (R2), so
  maximum-size files report length 0.** `:7730-7769`; callers `:6845-6854`.
  Confidence: high. BDOS fn 35 returns a 3-byte record count; only R0/R1 are
  read, R2 is forced to zero. At 65,536 records (8 MiB), the true count
  `00 00 01` becomes length 0, so `SEEK_END` returns 0 and append-mode
  positions at record 0 instead of EOF. **Fix direction:** fold all three
  fn-35 bytes into a 32-bit byte length; check fn-35's failure status; add
  reopen+`SEEK_END`/append boundary tests.
- **FI-2 — fd validation checks only the low byte of a 16-bit `int`; `_close`
  doesn't verify the slot is in use.** `_close` (`:6893-6942`), `_read`
  (`:7011-7043`), `_write` (`:7127-7140`), `__chkfd`/`__chkfda` (`:7467-7478`).
  Confidence: high. `0x0100` aliases stdin, `0x0103` aliases real fd 3, etc.;
  `_close` also reaches BDOS fn 16 with a stale FCB for a closed/never-opened
  slot. **Fix direction:** require the fd high byte to be zero before
  console dispatch/slot arithmetic; have `_close` check `__fduse` and return
  `EBADF` otherwise.
- **FI-3 — `open()` access-mode flags (`O_RDONLY`/`O_WRONLY`/`O_RDWR`) are
  parsed but never stored or enforced.** `opslot` (`:6732-6735`), `_open`
  (`:6813-6822`), `_read`/`_write` (`:7042`,`:7139`). Confidence: high. A
  descriptor opened `O_WRONLY` can still be `read()` and vice versa. **Fix
  direction:** record access mode per slot and reject wrong-direction
  operations with `EBADF`.
- **FI-4 — `O_CREAT`/`O_TRUNC` low-level semantics are inverted/wrong.**
  `opmake`/`opmake_new` (`:6818-6867`). Confidence: high. `O_CREAT` without
  `O_TRUNC` always append-positions (should start at offset 0 for an
  ordinary create); `O_TRUNC` without `O_CREAT` deletes-then-creates instead
  of returning `ENOENT`; the delete status from fn 19 is ignored entirely,
  so a failed delete can be followed by a fn-22 create CP/M treats as a
  fatal "make existing file" error. **Fix direction:** separate stdio-append
  from low-level `O_CREAT`; probe existence before truncating; require
  successful deletion before create; invoke fn 22 only when creation is
  actually permitted.
- **FI-5 — A zero-length `write()` can still extend the tracked file
  length.** `wrloop`/`wrfdone` (`:7154-7230`). Confidence: high.
  `write(fd,buf,0)` after seeking past EOF skips the BDOS write but still
  falls into the length-extending path, enlarging `__fdlen` (and later
  `SEEK_END`/append behavior) without touching the actual file. **Fix
  direction:** return 0 immediately for `count==0` before cache invalidation
  and length update.
- **FI-6 — Write errors lose partial progress, leave length stale, and
  collapse all BDOS fn-34 statuses to `ENOSPC`.** `wrnospc` and related
  (`:7175-7282`). Confidence: high. Any nonzero fn-34 status returns `-1`
  even after earlier records succeeded (advanced offset not reflected in
  length); distinct statuses (2=disk full, 5=dir full, 6=record out of
  range, 8=locked, 9=invalid FCB, 10/11=media/verify error, 0xFF=hardware)
  are all mapped to `ENOSPC`. **Fix direction:** on partial failure, extend
  length for the bytes actually transferred and return that count when
  nonzero; map error codes to distinct errno values (`EFBIG`, lock error,
  `EIO`, etc.).
- **FI-7 — Partial-write pre-read errors can zero-fill bytes that
  shouldn't be touched.** `wrrd` (`:7182-7195`). Confidence: high. Any
  nonzero fn-33 status triggers `__zerdm` (zero-fill), which is correct only
  for the documented unwritten-hole codes (1/4); genuine range/FCB/media/
  hardware errors (6,9,10,11,0xFF) instead get the untouched bytes replaced
  with `0x1A`. **Fix direction:** zero-fill only for confirmed
  unwritten-hole statuses; abort with `__fderr`/errno set for real I/O
  failures.
- **FI-8 — `lseek()` accepts negative/overflowing/unrepresentable
  offsets.** `lsset/lscur/lsend` (`:7305-7407`), `__setrr` (`:7790-7847`).
  Confidence: high. No sign/overflow/range check is applied; `__setrr` then
  silently drops offset bit 31 forming the CP/M random-record bytes, so
  e.g. `0x80000000` produces the *same* record bytes as offset 0 and can
  redirect I/O to record 0. **Fix direction:** compute into scratch, reject
  negative/overflowed/unrepresentable results with `EINVAL`/`EFBIG`, and
  leave the old position unchanged on rejection.
- **FI-9 — `fsync`/`fdatasync` report success without validating the fd or
  correctly driving BDOS fn 48.** `:7420-7455`. Confidence: high. The fd
  argument is never actually read (so invalid/closed fds "succeed"); the `E`
  flag for fn 48 is left arbitrary; a hardware-error (`A=0xFF`) result is
  ignored; dirty FCB/extent/allocation metadata isn't necessarily made
  durable by fn 48 alone. **Fix direction:** validate the fd/slot fully, set
  `E` explicitly, check the fn-48 status, and be honest about what durability
  is actually achieved (or route through a safe close/reopen for metadata).
- **FI-10 — `_rename` doesn't enforce its documented wildcard-rejection or
  cross-drive semantics.** `_rename`/`rnfail` (`:8148-8200`); wildcard
  expansion `__mkfcb` (`:8034-8088`). Confidence: high. Both parsed FCBs go
  straight to BDOS fn 23 without an ambiguous-name (`?`) check, so a
  wildcard old-name can rename multiple entries and a wildcard new-name can
  write literal `?` bytes on real CP/M, though the documentation promises
  rejection; drive bytes also aren't compared, so a genuine cross-drive
  rename returns `ENOENT` (via `rnfail`) instead of `EXDEV`. **Fix
  direction:** scan both parsed 11-byte names for `?` and return `EINVAL`;
  canonicalize default drives via BDOS fn 25 and reject differing drives
  with `EXDEV`.
- **FI-11 — Unambiguous random-read failures are silently reported as
  EOF.** `_read` (`:7074-7099`). Confidence: medium. The documented
  ambiguity justifies treating fn-33 codes 1/4 as EOF/unwritten-hole, but
  codes 9/10/11/0xFF (invalid FCB, media change, verify error, hardware
  error) are genuine failures currently given the same treatment with no
  errno/`__fderr` set. **Fix direction:** keep 1/4 as EOF; classify the
  others as real failures.
- **FI-12 — Successful transfer counts above `INT_MAX` are
  unrepresentable.** `_read`/`_write` (`:7047-7234`). Confidence: high.
  `size_t` is 16-bit unsigned but the public return is a 16-bit *signed*
  `int`; a successful 65,535-byte transfer is bit-identical to `-1`. **Fix
  direction:** cap each public transfer result at `INT_MAX` and let callers
  loop, or add an internal unsigned-count helper for stdio's larger
  requests.

### Optimisation

- **FI-13 — Repeated FCB-address reconstruction in the partial-write and
  `__rdsz` paths.** `wrrd` (`:7188-7220`), `__rdsz` (`:7731-7743`).
  Confidence: high. **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on partial-write/open-heavy
  `fileops`/`tfio`/`trw`; `.COM` size, peep+nopeep.
- **FI-14 — `_rename` has a cancelling `ex de,hl` / `ex de,hl` pair with no
  intervening state change.** `:8172-8177`. Confidence: high. **Measure:**
  `ntvcm -p`/size for `trename`/`trenwild`, peep+nopeep.

## Section 7 — 32-bit `long` arithmetic

`DCCRTL.MAC:8311-9486`: `__lmul` and multiply-helper variants, `__ldu`/
`__lmu` (long divide/modulo — home of the previously-fixed zero-interior-byte
bug), `__lds`/`__lms` (signed divide/modulo), and the compare family
`__ltu/__leu/__lgu/__lku/__lts/__lks/__lgs/__les`.

**Zero-interior-byte sibling scan (top priority for this section): PASS.**
The historic `__lmu` bug (`call nz` skipping a zero dividend byte that
appeared *after* a nonzero byte, corrupting the shift/remainder chain) is
confirmed still fixed and not regressed — traced byte-by-byte for
`16777217 % 7` (bytes `01 00 00 01`): only the *leading* zero bytes before
the first nonzero byte are skipped; every byte from the first nonzero byte
onward, including interior zeros, is processed unconditionally through the
call ladder, yielding the correct quotient/remainder. Every sibling routine
(`__lmul`,`__m1u`,`__m8u`,`__m1q`,`__m1s`,`__m1mu`,`__lds`,`__lms`, and all
compares) was checked for the same class of bug: conditional branches in
those routines only ever skip a *value-independent* add/shift-position, or
skip the low word only when the high word has already decided a compare —
none reproduces the interior-zero-byte defect.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** existing register-based `__lmul`,
the shared signed fast path, direct IX loads, and the comparison-epilogue
optimisation are already applied; splitting modulo into a separate core and
adding a divisor-one fast path were considered and explicitly deferred
(profiling tradeoff, not a defect); ABI (DE:HL convention, IX/stack
restore, IY untouched, only caller-saved BC/DE clobbered) verified correct
throughout.

### Robustness

- **LA-F1 — accepted in Batch 9.** The long core checks the complete divisor
  before its leading-byte skip and returns quotient `0xffffffff` with the
  original dividend remainder. Signed, unsigned, standalone, and paired
  divide/remainder paths now expose the same pair. Specialized fused `__m1mu`
  instead defines its modulus-zero dividend sentinel at its 16-bit result
  width as `low16(a*b)`, not either input operand or the full 32-bit product.
- **LA-F9 — documented in Batch 9; no executable special case.**
  `LONG_MIN/-1` remains undefined C behavior. DCC's runtime follows
  two's-complement wrap to `LONG_MIN` with remainder zero rather than adding a
  trap or saturation branch.

### Optimisation

- **LA-F2 — Adjacent long `%` then `/` on the same operands recompute the
  whole division instead of reusing the core's already-produced pair.**
  Wrappers `:8846-9181`; core contract `:8876-8880`. Confidence: high.
  `tests/tpi.c:22-23` has exactly this shape (`d % b` then `d /= b`); generic
  compiler div/mod fusion currently excludes anything wider than 2 bytes
  (`dcc_mir_spilled_cfg.c:15043-15053`, `dcc_ast_gen_support.c:2466-2468`).
  **Fix direction:** extend compiler divmod fusion to 32-bit values, or
  expose a fused long helper/cache (mirroring `_ldiv`'s existing remainder
  reuse). **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on `tpi` and a generic adjacent-long-divmod
  microbenchmark; final size.
- **LA-F3 — The fast 16-bit-divisor path still pays for the general path's
  output zero-initialization.** `__ludivmod_core` (`:8882-9013`).
  Confidence: high. ~74 avoidable T-states per 16-bit-divisor call. **Fix
  direction:** dispatch on divisor width before initializing. **Measure:**
  `ntvcm -p` on `tpi`/`pihex`/`tlmod`; linked size.
- **LA-F4 — Three `or a` carry-clears in the general divider are dead**
  (`ADD HL,HL` never consumes incoming carry). `:8897,8924,8934`. Confidence:
  high. ~256 T-states per general (32-bit-divisor) division. **Measure:**
  `ntvcm -p` for divisors > 65535; linked size.
- **LA-F5 — `__lmul`'s low-result spill to static memory can instead stay
  on the stack.** `:8393-8434`; scratch `:10165-10166`. Confidence: high.
  `__lm_res_h` is entirely unreferenced (dead). **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` for
  `tpi`/`tmuldiv`; size.
- **LA-F6 — Five `ld sp,ix` epilogues are redundant** (SP already equals
  IX on every path reaching them, matching a prior, already-applied fix to
  the comparison routines). `:8434,8849,8872,9130,9198`. Confidence: high.
  **Measure:** size and `ntvcm -p`; ~2 bytes/10 T-states per removed site.
- **LA-F7 — Unsigned-compare result materialization is unnecessarily
  branchy** — carry can convert directly to boolean via
  zero+rotate-carry (`<`/`>`) or `sbc hl,hl`+`inc` (`<=`/`>=`). `__ltu`
  (`:9232`), `__leu` (`:9260`), `__lgu` (`:9289`), `__lku` (`:9317`).
  Confidence: high. **Measure:** comparison-heavy cycles and size.
- **LA-F8 — `__m1mu` always runs 8 provably-empty leading iterations when
  the multiplier's high byte is zero.** `:8550-8585`. Confidence: medium.
  **Fix direction:** for `D==0`, shift byte-position instead of bit-looping
  8 empty times; return immediately for a zero multiplier/multiplicand.
  **Measure:** `ntvcm -p` on `pihex`/powermod-style workloads; size.

## Section 8 — `ctype.h` + `FILE*`-buffered stdio

`DCCRTL.MAC:10185-10683` (ctype helpers, `_fgets`, `_gets`) and
`:11050-11906` (`_fopen/_fclose/_tmpnam/_tmpfile/_freopen/_fread/_fwrite/
_fseek/_ftell/_fgetpos/_fsetpos/_rewind/_feof/_ferror`).

**Pushback-interaction verdict (specifically requested):** **partially
confirms, partially refutes** the console/BDOS section's `_ungetc` findings.
Real-file `_fgets` (`:10478-10498`) *does* correctly check and consume
`__ugv[fd]`/`__ugc[fd]` — refuting a blanket claim there. But **console**
`fgets`/`gets` call BDOS directly and ignore stdin pushback entirely, and
real-file `_fread` calls `_read` directly with no pushback check either —
confirming the gap for those specific paths (see **CT-F3**, cross-referenced
from **CI-5**).

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** functional `clearerr`/`ferror`,
`fgetc`'s EOF flagging, `_fread`'s bad-fd clamp/fd-bounds check, the
size-product overflow check, `size==0` handling, the size-1 fast path,
8 real file slots, and the corrected `rewind` call-frame are all already
fixed per `archive/runtime-memory-optimisations.md` and recent commits;
initial-append preservation and seek-to-end are fixed (**CT-F6** below is
specifically about writes *after* a later reposition, a distinct case);
`tmpfile` double-close prevention is fixed (**CT-F8** is the distinct
close-time non-removal gap); CP/M record-rounded lengths, trailing-Ctrl-Z
padding ambiguity and sparse-gap fill are documented/deferred; immediate
read-after-write sequencing is governed by the C rule and file output here
is write-through, so no separate buffering defect exists; no ABI/IY/stack
issue was found outside **CT-F1**.

### Correctness

- **CT-F1 — `_fseek` discards `_lseek`'s actual result.**
  `:11603-11638` (`fseek_ok_clear`). Confidence: high. After calling
  `_lseek`, the argument-cleanup sequence pushes/pops such that the value
  actually tested is the *original* `offset_hi`/`whence` arguments, not the
  saved `_lseek` result — so `fseek(f,0,99)` gets `_lseek==-1` internally but
  tests an unrelated stack value and reports success; for an out-of-range
  `fp`, it also clears `__fdeof` at an out-of-bounds array index. **Fix
  direction:** remove the two spurious result-pushes; discard the four
  arguments with four `pop bc` so `DE:HL` (the real result) survives intact;
  add a defensive `fp` range check before touching `__fdeof`.
- **CT-F2 — `_fwrite` turns any write failure into a huge or falsely
  successful item count.** `:11538-11567`; failure source `wrnospc`
  (`:7271-7282`). Confidence: high. `_write` returns `0xffff` on disk
  failure (even after partial output); with `size=1` this becomes item count
  `65535`; with `size=32768,nmemb=1` it divides down to a falsely-successful
  `1`. **Fix direction:** preserve the accumulated successful byte count on a
  valid-stream failure, clamp a genuine total failure to 0 items, and return
  only complete items.
- **CT-F3 — Pushback is honored inconsistently across read paths** (see
  cross-reference to **CI-5** above for the full picture): console `fgets`/
  `gets` and real-file `fread` ignore pending pushback; real-file `fgets`
  handles it but then can mistake a pushed-back `0x1A` for physical EOF;
  because `_fgets` checks `__fdeof` *before* pushback, the `_ungetc` EOF-clear
  gap (**CI-3**) prevents a pending byte from ever being reached. **Fix
  direction:** centralize pushback consumption; distinguish a pushed `0x1A`
  from real physical EOF; check pushback before the cached-EOF gate.
- **CT-F4 — Pushback survives seeks, closes, and descriptor reuse** (same
  root cause as **CI-4**, confirmed from this section's side too): `_fopen`
  (`:11077-11089`), `_fseek` (`:11629-11638`), `_rewind` (`:11818-11826`),
  and the close path (`:6893-6968`) none clear `__ugv`. **Fix direction:**
  clear the fd's pushback-valid flag after successful open/close/`fseek`/
  `fsetpos`/`rewind`.
- **CT-F5 — Every ctype helper aliases out-of-range `int` values through
  the low byte only.** `:10186-10422` (`__ctu,__csp,__cdg,__caa,__can,
  __cup,__clo,__cxd,__cpr,__cct,__cpu,__ctl`). Confidence: high.
  `isdigit(0x0130)==1`, `iscntrl(0x0100)==1`, `toupper(0x0161)==0x0041` —
  under the full-`int` C99 contract these should be false/unchanged (ASCII
  0/127/128-255 and EOF(-1) themselves are handled correctly; it's other
  nonzero-high-byte values that leak through). **Fix direction:** require a
  zero high byte before ASCII classification; have converters return the
  original full value otherwise.
- **CT-F6 — `fopen`'s mode string is barely parsed and not retained.**
  `:11051-11068`. Confidence: high. Only the first character is inspected;
  no per-slot mode state is stored, so: append writes aren't forced back to
  EOF after an intervening `fseek`; `"rb"`'s binary intent has no effect (so
  `fgets` still treats `0x1A` as EOF); malformed modes (`""`,`"q"`) silently
  create/open a file instead of failing. **Fix direction:** validate the
  C89 mode grammar, store access/binary/append state per slot, and force
  each append-mode write back to the current logical EOF.
- **CT-F7 — `tmpnam` never checks for name collisions.** `:11127-11184`.
  Confidence: high. It only increments a 3-digit counter with no existence
  probe; `T000.TMP` collides on the very first call in a directory that
  already has one, and the counter wraps onto active names after 1000
  calls. **Fix direction:** probe candidate existence/active slots, retry up
  to `TMP_MAX`, return `NULL` when exhausted.
- **CT-F8 — Closing a `tmpfile()` stream leaves the backing file on disk.**
  `:11188-11259` (`_tmpfile`); `_close` (`:6903-6934`). Confidence: high.
  `_close` clears the registry entry but never unlinks the recorded name, so
  normal-exit cleanup skips it too — C requires automatic removal on close
  or normal termination. **Fix direction:** on a registered temp fd, close
  and unlink its name before freeing the registry entry (keep the
  registration if the close itself fails).
- **CT-F9 — `freopen` doesn't reliably preserve the `stream` identity.**
  `:11328-11349`; lowest-slot allocation in `_open` (`:6713-6728`).
  Confidence: high. It assumes the just-closed slot is the lowest free slot;
  if a lower slot happens to already be free, the new open lands elsewhere,
  violating "returns `stream`"; `freopen(...,stdin)` similarly opens a new
  real fd while global `stdin` stays console fd 0. **Fix direction:** reopen
  directly into the designated slot and preserve stream identity, including
  for the standard streams.
- **CT-F10 — Console EOF handling is inconsistent across entry points.**
  `_fgets` (`:10577-10618`), `_gets` (`:10634-10680`), `_feof`
  (`:11835-11858`). Confidence: high. An immediate Ctrl-Z on console input
  makes `_gets` return an empty string instead of `NULL`; `_feof(stdin)`
  always returns 0 because only real-file slots have an EOF flag. **Fix
  direction:** track stdin EOF explicitly; return `NULL` from `gets` when
  Ctrl-Z arrives before any character; have `clearerr`/`ungetc` update that
  state too.
- **CT-F11 — `rewind` doesn't clear the error indicator, only EOF.**
  `:11792-11830`. Confidence: high. After a disk-full write sets
  `__fderr`, `rewind(f)` leaves `ferror(f)` true — `rewind` is required to
  clear both. **Fix direction:** clear both slot indicators, ideally via a
  shared state-reset helper.
- **CT-F12 — `fseek`/`lseek` accept negative/overflowed final positions
  and only test the low byte of `whence`.** `_fseek` (`:11576-11647`),
  `_lseek` (`:7285-7389`). Confidence: high (same root defect family as
  **FI-8**, seen again from this section's wrapper). **Fix direction:**
  validate the complete signed result and the full 16-bit `whence` before
  committing.
- **CT-F13 — `tmpfile` doesn't reset EOF/error flags on a reused slot.**
  `:11193-11257`; contrast `_fopen`'s reset at `:11077-11089`. Confidence:
  high. A slot whose previous file hit EOF can make `feof(tmpfile())`
  immediately true. **Fix direction:** move slot-indicator initialization
  into one shared successful-open helper used by both `_fopen` and
  `_tmpfile`.
- **CT-F14 — `NTMP`/`TN_NSZ` constants sit in the wrong `dccrtlstrip`
  block.** Defined at `:11118-11119` (inside `_fclose`'s block per the
  scan) but consumed by `_close` and `_tmpfile`, neither of which depends on
  `_fclose`. Confidence: medium. A program that only closes files or only
  calls `tmpfile()` (never `fclose`) can end up missing these constants
  under `dccrtlstrip`. **Fix direction:** move these zero-cost EQUs into the
  always-kept preamble or an explicit shared prelude.
- **CT-F16 — `fread(stdin)` performs at most one character regardless of
  the requested size.** `:11437-11487`; `_read`'s stdin path
  (`:7016-7035`). Confidence: medium. `fread(buf,2,1,stdin)` copies one byte
  and returns 0 complete items with no EOF/error indicated. **Fix
  direction:** loop console reads until the requested count, EOF, or error.

### Robustness

- **CT-F15 — Negative `fgets` sizes are treated as a huge buffer.**
  `:10434-10441`. Confidence: high. The documented `size<=0` check only
  tests zero; `size=-1` becomes remaining-count `0xfffe`, permitting a
  massive overwrite. **Fix direction:** reject a set sign bit as well as
  zero.
- **CT-F17 — `_fread`'s `0xffff`-means-`EBADF` clamp aliases a maximal
  successful transfer.** `:11474-11487`. Confidence: high. `size=1,
  nmemb=65535` legitimately returns `0xffff` from `_read` on success too,
  and is misreported as 0 items. **Fix direction:** disambiguate via
  explicit fd/status checks, or chunk large transfers.
- **CT-F18 — An out-of-range `rewind(fp)` can write beyond the `__fdeof`
  array.** `:11818-11826`. Confidence: high. Same class as the `_fseek`
  bounds gap in **CT-F1**; e.g. `rewind((FILE*)200)` after a failed
  `_lseek` still subtracts `FIRSTFD` and writes out of bounds. **Fix
  direction:** require the computed slot `< NFILES` before touching any
  per-slot state.
- **CT-F19 — `isgraph(expr)`'s macro expansion evaluates its argument
  twice.** `ctype.h:21`. Confidence: high. `isgraph(s[i++])` can increment
  `i` twice and classify two different bytes. **Fix direction:** implement
  `isgraph` as a real runtime function with its own assembler mapping
  instead of a two-evaluation macro.

**Position round-trip verdict:** `_fgetpos`/`_fsetpos` correctly round-trip
all four offset bytes when there's no pending pushback (`:11709-11776`);
error propagation is broken only by **CT-F1**, and pushback interaction is
the separate gap in **CT-F3**/**CT-F4**.

### Optimisation

- **CT-F20 — Six call sites use an expensive 3-word stack-discard sequence
  where three `pop bc` (or one `pop bc` for a 1-word discard) would do.**
  `_fgets` (`:10509`), `_gets` (`:10648`), `__fps` (`:11398`), `_fread`
  (`:11448`), `_fwrite` (`:11548`), `_fgetpos` (`:11709,11737`). Confidence:
  high. **Measure:** linked `.COM` size and `ntvcm -p` for `tfio`/`tfpos`/
  `ttmp`/`fileops`, peep+nopeep.

## Section 9 — `scanf` family + `setjmp`/`longjmp` + directory ops + `perror`

`DCCRTL.MAC:11907-13018`: `_scanf/_sscanf/_fscanf/__scan_run` (the shared
core, **very recently and fully rewritten** — "IX-free, absolute vararg
pointer, leaner arithmetic" — given the most skeptical read in this audit),
`_setjmp/_longjmp`, `_dopn/_drd/_dcls` (opendir/readdir/closedir), `_perror`.

**setjmp/longjmp verdict: CORRECT.** The exact IY save/restore instruction
sequences required by `scripts/rtl-iy-safety.py`'s
`reviewed_nonlocal_jump_regions()` proof were independently re-verified at
`:12691-12697`/`:12754-12758`, including reasoning beyond "the script still
passes": `_setjmp` saves entry-SP+2 plus IX/IY; `_longjmp` restores IX/IY
while the old stack is still active, recovers the saved return address/value,
switches SP, pushes the saved return address, and returns — this remains
correct through arbitrary nested call depth.

**Scanf `"%d %s %f"` trace (as requested):** `%d` advances the vararg
pointer by 2, `%s` by another 2; `%f` is simply absent from the dispatch
table (`:12107-12124`), so the call returns assignment-count `2`, leaves the
float argument's pointer unread and the float itself unchanged — floating
input and scansets are documented as not-yet-implemented
(`docs/docs/en/standard-lib/05-stdio.md:122-165`), so this specific gap is
known/expected, not a new finding.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** vararg entry offsets and the two-byte
per-argument advancement are correct and stack-balanced throughout; `perror`
(NULL/empty prefix, `_errno` linkage, balanced `_strerror` call, CR/LF
output) is correct, with prior fixes already documented
(`archive/runtime-performance-optimisation.md:287-350`); normal directory
iteration (result-index rotation, bounded 13-byte name construction, EOD
handling, the already-fixed DMA restore) is sound.

### Correctness

- **SJ-F1 — `sc_get_file` clobbers register `B`, breaking literal-character
  matching from file/console input.** `sc_loop` (`:12023-12029`) saves the
  expected literal character in `B`, but `sc_get_file` (`:12437-12447`) does
  `pop bc` to discard an argument — since valid fds have a zero high byte,
  this zeroes `B`. Confidence: **very high**. `fscanf(fp,"A=%d",&v)` on input
  `"A=42"` therefore fails to match the leading `"A="` and returns 0;
  `scanf` has the identical defect (`sscanf` is unaffected because its
  string-source path never clobbers `BC`). **Fix direction:** preserve the
  format character across the `sc_get` call at this site, restoring it
  before the match/carry branch; add file- and console-literal-prefix
  regression tests.
- **SJ-F2 — Leading-zero lookahead for `%i`/`%x` double-consumes field
  width.** `sc_num_after_sign`/`sc_num_not_auto` (`:12267-12318`).
  Confidence: **very high**. After a leading `0`, the routine peeks the next
  character via `sc_get_w` (consuming 1 unit of width), un-gets it if it's
  not `x`, then fetches it *again* later — both fetches decrement
  `sc_width`. Traced: `sscanf("07Z","%2i%c",&v,&ch)` yields `v=0, ch='7'`
  instead of the correct `v=7, ch='Z'`; `%2x` on `"0fZ"` fails analogously.
  **Fix direction:** refund the width before un-getting, or process the
  already-read lookahead character directly instead of re-fetching it.
- **SJ-F3 — Scanner-private pushback (`sc_ungot`/`sc_unch`) is invisible
  to the stream-level per-fd pushback mechanism.** `:11984-12006`,
  `:12416-12464` vs. the runtime pushback at `:716-805`. Confidence: **very
  high**. After `fscanf(fp,"%d",&v)` reads `"12x"`, the physical file
  position is already past `x`, and `x` exists only in the scanner-private
  variable — a following `fgetc(fp)` bypasses it entirely; scanning a second
  fd clobbers the first fd's pending character; a seek/rewind or fd reuse
  can expose stale scanner state. **Fix direction:** route file/console
  scanning through the stream-level per-fd pushback instead of a private
  global; keep a private mechanism only for `sscanf`'s in-memory source;
  ensure seek/close/reopen clear it.
- **SJ-F4 — Every directory handle aliases one global enumeration.**
  `_dopn/_drd/_dcls` (`:12807-12970`). Confidence: high. `_dopn` always
  returns the same `&__drfcb`; opening a second directory overwrites the
  first's in-progress scan state, `readdir()` on the "first" handle then
  reads the second's results, and `closedir()` on either invalidates both.
  `_drd`/`_dcls` accept any non-NULL pointer / ignore their argument
  entirely. **Fix direction:** give each handle real per-handle state, or
  explicitly detect/reject a second concurrent open and validate the handle
  in `readdir`/`closedir`.
- **SJ-F5 — `opendir`'s no-match path is indistinguishable from failure
  and leaves stale `errno`/state.** `__drgo`/`__drnul` (`:12843-12859`).
  Confidence: medium. BDOS "search first" returning failure (0xFF) jumps to
  the same NULL-return label used for a normal empty result; `errno` isn't
  set and `__dridx` isn't reset, so `perror("opendir")` after an
  empty-directory `opendir` reports an unrelated stale error. **Fix
  direction:** define zero-match semantics explicitly (prefer a "done"
  handle whose first `readdir` returns `NULL`), or set a defined error and
  reset state before returning `NULL`.
- **SJ-F7 — The in-file scanner banner comment is stale relative to the
  actual (rewritten) implementation.** `:11894-11902`. Confidence: very
  high (documentation defect only). It claims IX-bound offset varargs; the
  code beneath is IX-free with an absolute `sc_argp`. **Fix direction:**
  update the comment to match the audited ABI.

### Optimisation

- **SJ-F6 — Assignment-suppression (`sc_assign`) is re-tested every
  character inside `%s`/`%c`'s hot copy loop** even though it's invariant
  for the whole conversion. `:12176-12233`. Confidence: medium. **Measure:**
  `ntvcm -p` for long `%s`/wide `%c`; linked size, peep+nopeep — worth doing
  only if splitting assigned/suppressed loops doesn't cost more size than it
  saves.

## Section 10 — Float/IEEE-754 core: classification, predicates, arithmetic

`DCCRTL.MAC:13019-17100`: classification, the **very recently changed**
predicates (`__feqf/__fnef/__fcmpsf/__fltf/__fgtf/__flef/__fgef` — most
recent commit to the whole file: "Speed up float predicates with bit-shift
masking tricks"), conversions, add/sub, mul, div, round/floor/ceil, fmod,
sqrt, float↔long conversions, `nextafterf`. No sub-range was only skimmed
except two callee-only cross-checks (`__fmaf`/`__fmadd` scheduling and the
`_fmodf` reduction loop), both reviewed closely enough to find no defect.

**Recent predicate-optimisation commit verdict: CORRECT, no regression.**
Traced `0x80000000`(`-0`)→`__fzro`, `0x7FC00000`(qNaN)→`__fnan`,
`0x7F800000`(+Inf)→`__finf` (not NaN), `0x7F7FFFFF`(FLT_MAX, `D=0x7F`)
correctly classified finite despite the high exponent byte, negative-vs-
negative ordering (`-3` vs `-2`), `+0`/`-0` equality, NaN unordered
(`==` false, `!=` true), and infinity ordering — all correct. **This
session independently re-confirmed the subnormal-arithmetic finding below
(FC-F2) by tracing the actual current instructions** (see the "READ THIS
FIRST" section and the trace embedded there).

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `_floorf`/`_ceilf`/`_fmodf`
special/subnormal handling is sound, with strong raw-bit test coverage
already in `tests/tfmodfsp.c:78-117`; the documented add/mul
truncate-instead-of-round-to-nearest limitation (**FC-F3**/**FC-F4** below)
already has a prior note at `archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md:289-296`
— included here with concrete failing inputs because it's directly
adjacent to the newly-found subnormal defect, not because it's unknown; the
known, deferred large-argument `sqrtf` accuracy limit (commit `69798ca`) was
not re-reported; no ABI/IY/stack-balance defect was found.

### Correctness

- **FC-F2 — Subnormal operands/results are corrupted throughout
  add/sub/mul/div/scale/sqrt.** Add/sub: `FANZ_ENTRY`/`FNORMR`/`FUNR`/`FPKR`
  (`:13990-14274`); mul/fmadd: `FMBODY`/`FMZERO_E` etc. (`:14545-15131`);
  div: `FD_ORDINARY` etc. (`:15626-15869`); sqrt/scale
  (`:16456-16699`). Confidence: **high — independently re-traced and
  confirmed by this session against the live source** (see "READ THIS FIRST"
  for the full byte-level trace). Concrete failures: `0x00000001+0x00000001`
  (min subnormal + itself, correct answer `0x00000002`) returns `0x75000000`
  because `FNORMR`'s renormalize loop's `djnz` decrements the *exponent*
  register starting from 0 (subnormal) and wraps through 234 iterations
  instead of recognizing "still subnormal, don't renormalize this far";
  `0x00000001+0.0` incorrectly returns `0`; `0x00800000*0x3F000000` (min
  normal × 0.5, correct answer `0x00400000`) returns `0` via a wrong
  exponent-zero-means-multiply-by-zero shortcut; `0x7F800000*0x00000001`
  (Inf × subnormal) wrongly returns NaN instead of Inf; `sqrtf` of any
  subnormal reaches an internal all-exponent-zero division and returns NaN.
  **Fix direction:** normalize exponent-zero significands using an effective
  exponent of 1 and a signed internal exponent throughout, explicitly
  prevent `FNORMR`'s zero-exponent `djnz` wraparound, and gradually pack
  subnormal results instead of flushing/garbling them; `_fmodf`'s existing
  subnormal handling is a working model to follow.
- **FC-F1 — `nextafterf(+Inf, finite)` returns NaN instead of the adjacent
  finite value.** `_nextafterf`/`NXFMAX_NZ`/`NXINC` (`:16878-17067`).
  Confidence: high. For `x=+Inf,y=FLT_MAX`: the FLT_MAX fast path doesn't
  match, `x` isn't NaN, isn't FLT_MAX, isn't zero, and has positive sign, so
  it falls into the plain-increment path, which turns `0x7F800000` into
  `0x7F800001` — a signaling NaN — instead of `0x7F7FFFFF`. **Fix
  direction:** special-case `±Inf` in this fast path (or route it through
  the comparison-based `NXGEN` path, which already picks the right
  direction).
- **FC-F3 — Add/sub alignment truncates instead of rounding to nearest.**
  `FALGNR`/`FSHR` (`:14037-14309`). Confidence: high (context: already
  noted at `archive/c-runtime-optimisations-bug-fixes.md:289-296`).
  `0x3F800000 + 0x33C00000` (`1.0 + 3·2⁻²⁵`, 0.75 ULP above 1.0) truncates the
  negligible-looking smaller operand instead of rounding up, returning
  `0x3F800000` where round-to-nearest requires `0x3F800001`. **Fix
  direction:** carry guard/round/sticky bits through alignment and the
  mantissa-overflow shift; apply ties-to-even before packing.
- **FC-F4 — Multiply and fused multiply-add discard a round-up remainder
  the same way.** `FMDONE`/`FMNOC` (`:14802-14849`), `FQDONE`/`FQNOC`
  (`:15392-15421`). Confidence: high; already partly documented via
  `tests/tfmedge.c:38-42`. For `a=0x3F800348, b=0x3F801384`, the exact
  significand product's discarded remainder exceeds the halfway point, so
  the no-carry path truncates to `0x3F8016CC` instead of rounding up to
  `0x3F8016CD`; `__fmadd` inherits the same error for a `+0` addend. **Fix
  direction:** retain guard+sticky from the discarded product bytes and
  increment (with mantissa-carry-into-exponent) when required.
- **FC-F5 — Runtime long→float conversion doesn't implement its own
  documented nearest-rounding contract.** `__fulf`/`__flf` (`:16718-16779`);
  caller mapping `dcc_expr.c:1270-1279`. Confidence: high. `LONG_MAX
  =0x7FFFFFFF` normalizes with one shift to `0xFFFFFFFE`/exponent 157, and
  the pack step silently discards the low byte (`0xFE`), producing
  `2147483520` instead of the nearest single `2147483648`
  (`0x4F000000`); `ULONG_MAX` similarly rounds down instead of up. This
  contradicts `docs/docs/en/03-types-and-conventions.md:28-30`'s
  documented nearest-rounding guarantee. **Fix direction:** round the
  discarded bits with guard/sticky and ties-to-even, including exponent
  carry-out; test with raw-bit comparisons using runtime (non-constant-
  folded) long values.

### Optimisation

- **FC-F6 — The recent predicate bit-masking trick (commit `f68ca74`)
  hasn't been extended to several adjacent comparisons that could use the
  same identities.** `:13235-13644` (various). Confidence: high. Estimated
  ~36 bytes / ~20 T-states per common positive ordered comparison, applying
  only where the resulting carry is dead. **Measure:** assembled/stripped
  size and `ntvcm -p` on `tc89fcmp`/`tctxflt` and a comparison-heavy loop,
  peep+nopeep.
- **FC-F7 — `_fabsf` misses an available tail-call.** `:15911-15921`.
  Confidence: high. `call __fabs / ret` → `jp __fabs` (or inline the single
  `res 7,d`). **Measure:** `.COM` size and `ntvcm -p` on a repeated-`fabsf`
  microbenchmark (~1 byte/17 T-states expected per call).

## Section 11 — Transcendental math (generated-then-hand-maintained)

`DCCRTL.MAC:17101-19955`: `_expf/_logf/_log10f/_powf/_sinhf/_coshf/_tanhf/
_sinf/_cosf/_tanf/_atanf/_atan2f/_asinf/_acosf/_frexpf/_ldexpf/_modff`. This
block is explicitly hand-maintained now (no longer regenerated from
`mathf.c`), so it was treated as first-class code, not skimmed as "generated
output." A few coefficient-by-coefficient polynomial ranges were spot-checked
rather than formally exhausted (see the list at the end of this section).

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** existing special-value fixes for
`_expf` (NaN/Inf), `_logf` (NaN/zero/negative/Inf), `_atan2f` (Inf/NaN,
zero-zero combinations), `_asinf`/`_acosf` domain returns, `_frexpf`/
`_ldexpf` (Inf/NaN), and `_modff` (Inf) were verified present and correct;
the documented `powf(-0, negative-odd)` defect (`tests/tpowfsp.c:10-13`) is
subsumed by **MT-F5** below; ordinary 5-6-digit polynomial approximation
error is explicitly already documented
(`docs/docs/en/standard-lib/08-math.md:80-86`) and not re-reported; no ABI,
IY, or stack-balance defect was found; misleading comments in `_expf`/
`_atan2f`/`_modff` were noted but not counted as functional defects.

### Correctness

- **MT-F1 — `expf` overflows to `+Inf` too early.** `:17150-17165`.
  Confidence: high. The overflow threshold test uses `88.0` where the true
  overflow point is near `logf(FLT_MAX) ≈ 88.72284`; `expf(88.5f)` returns
  `+Inf` although the true result (`≈2.723e38`) is representable. **Fix
  direction:** move the threshold to ~88.72284f with an explicit separate
  `+Inf` case.
- **MT-F2 — `powf(negative, non-integer)` returns 0 instead of the
  required NaN/domain error.** `:17721-17773` (`_powf`/`MFL19`). Confidence:
  high. `powf(-2.0f, 0.5f)`: the fractional-exponent branch returns `0`
  outright. **Fix direction:** return quiet NaN and report the domain error
  on this branch.
- **MT-F3 — `powf` has several NaN-input special-case holes.**
  `:17649-17773`. Confidence: high. `powf(NAN,0.5f)` and `powf(-2,NAN)` both
  wrongly return 0 (or Inf, depending on NaN sign bit) via the
  negative-base path; `powf(0.0f,NAN)` returns 0/Inf instead of propagating
  NaN; `powf(1.0f,NAN)` computes `NAN*logf(1)` and returns NaN where C99
  requires exactly `1`. **Fix direction:** reorder special-casing as:
  `y==0` → `x==1` → NaN checks → zero/infinity table → ordinary computation.
- **MT-F4 — Infinite/very-large integral exponents are misclassified for
  negative bases.** `:17721-17773`. Confidence: high. Integer-ness of `y`
  is currently detected via a signed-`long` round-trip of `abs(y)`, which
  saturates for `powf(-2,+Inf)`/`powf(-1,+Inf)` and fails the round-trip
  check, wrongly returning 0 instead of `+Inf`/`1`; representable integral
  exponents ≥ 2³¹ fail the same way. **Fix direction:** classify infinite
  exponents first; determine integrality/parity directly from the float's
  exponent/mantissa bits rather than via a `long` conversion.
- **MT-F5 — `powf` loses the sign required for a `±0` result.**
  `:17664-17687`. Confidence: high. The zero-base branch only inspects the
  *exponent's* sign, so `powf(-0.0f,3.0f)` returns `+0` (should be `-0`) and
  `powf(-0.0f,-3.0f)` returns `+Inf` (should be `-Inf`). **Fix direction:**
  combine the base's sign with the exponent's finite-integer parity before
  selecting the zero/infinity branch.
- **MT-F6 — `tanf` returns 0 at the rounded float value of π/2** instead of
  the correct very-large result. `:18522-18736`. Confidence: high. At input
  bits `0x3fc90fdb` (`1.5707963705f`), range reduction subtracts the
  operand from the *same stored constant* it was derived from, producing an
  exact-zero residual (correct `tanf` here is ≈ `-2.29e7`, not 0); the
  inversion path then explicitly special-cases a zero reduced-polynomial
  result as tangent-zero. **Fix direction:** reduce using split high/low π
  constants (Cody–Waite-style) so the true residual from π/2 survives
  instead of cancelling to exactly zero; don't treat a zero reduced value as
  automatically tangent-zero.
- **MT-F7 — Large finite trig arguments can have a wholly wrong phase, not
  just reduced precision.** `_sinf`(`:18080-18138`), `_cosf`(`:18291-18349`),
  `_tanf`(`:18522-18582`). Confidence: high. Range reduction uses a single
  rounded-float π constant; for `1e20f`, `sinf` returns ≈`-0.9147` where the
  correct value is ≈`+0.6566` — a large-magnitude limitation is already
  documented (`docs/docs/en/standard-lib/08-math.md:82-86`), but the error
  is catastrophic rather than merely low-bit degradation. **Fix direction:**
  Cody–Waite plus large-argument (Payne–Hanek-style) reduction, or enforce a
  documented supported-magnitude cutoff rather than silently mis-phasing.
- **MT-F8 — `sinf(-0)` and `atanf(-0)` return `+0` instead of preserving
  the sign.** `_sinf`(`:18202-18267`), `_atanf`(`:18786-18990`). Confidence:
  high. Polynomial evaluation of `-0` cubed then summed with the core's
  zero-sum path (which favors `+0` for a same-value opposite-sign-looking
  sum) loses the sign. **Fix direction:** early-return the original operand
  for either signed zero.
- **MT-F9 — `atan2f` still mishandles `y=-0` with finite nonzero `x`.**
  `:19175-19247`. Confidence: high. `atan2f(-0,+1)` returns `+0` (should be
  `-0`); `atan2f(-0,-1)` returns `+π` (should be `-π`). **Fix direction:**
  handle `y==0` explicitly before division, using `y`'s sign for the result.
- **MT-F10 — `sinhf`/`tanhf` lose signed zero and flush tiny nonzero
  inputs to zero.** `_sinhf`(`:17875-17907`), `_tanhf`(`:18007-18055`).
  Confidence: high. `sinhf(-0)`/`tanhf(-0)` both return `+0`; for
  `x=1e-8f`, the intermediate `expf`-based formula rounds to exactly `1`, so
  both return `0` instead of ≈`1e-8`. **Fix direction:** return `x` directly
  for zero; use a small-argument polynomial or `expm1`-style formulation for
  tiny inputs.
- **MT-F11 — `sinhf`/`coshf` overflow to `Inf` before the true result
  does.** `:17875-17953`. Confidence: high. At `x=89.0f`, the intermediate
  `expf(x)` is already `+Inf` even though `sinhf(89)`/`coshf(89)`
  (≈`2.245e38`) are both still representable. **Fix direction:** for large
  magnitude, evaluate a scaled form (e.g. `expf(|x|-ln2)`) that avoids the
  overflowing intermediate.
- **MT-F12 — `frexpf`/`ldexpf` don't support subnormals** (and `_logf`
  inherits the bug via `frexpf`). `_frexpf`(`:19652-19680`),
  `_ldexpf`(`:19746-19821`). Confidence: high. `frexpf` of the minimum
  subnormal returns the wrong mantissa/exponent pair (`≈0.5f`/`-126` instead
  of `0.5f`/`-148`); `ldexpf(minsubnormal,0)` flushes to `0` instead of
  returning the input unchanged. **Fix direction:** normalize subnormal
  significands with a signed effective exponent; generate subnormal outputs
  by shift/round instead of flushing them; fix `_logf`'s dependency
  automatically once `frexpf` is fixed.
- **MT-F13 — `ldexpf`'s exponent arithmetic wraps for large positive
  `int`.** `:19747-19793`. Confidence: high. `ldexpf(1.0f,32767)` computes
  a biased exponent that wraps into the signed-negative range and is
  misread as underflow, returning `0` instead of `+Inf`. **Fix direction:**
  bound-check `n` against overflow/underflow *before* the addition, or sum
  in a wider signed representation.
- **MT-F14 — Decomposition functions erase a required negative-zero
  sign.** `_frexpf`(`:19633-19650`), `_ldexpf`(`:19733-19744`),
  `_modff`(`:19934-19944`). Confidence: high. `frexpf(-0)`/`ldexpf(-0,n)`
  explicitly return all-zero (losing sign); `modff(-3.0f,&i)`'s exact-zero
  fractional part loses the required negative sign too. **Fix direction:**
  return the original zero (with sign) from `frexpf`/`ldexpf`; copy the
  input's sign onto a zero fractional result in `modff`.
- **MT-F15 — No math-error-reporting mechanism is observable anywhere in
  this block.** e.g. `_expf`(`:17162-17184`), `_logf`(`:17405-17434`),
  `_asinf`(`:19333-19342`); `math.h:1-92`. Confidence: medium. Domain/pole/
  overflow/underflow branches never set `errno`, and `math.h` defines
  neither `math_errhandling` nor `MATH_ERRNO`/`MATH_ERREXCEPT` even though
  `EDOM` exists (`errno.h:71-74`). **Fix direction:** if C89/C99 errno-based
  math error reporting is intended, expose `MATH_ERRNO` and set `EDOM`/
  `ERANGE` on the appropriate branches (careful to exclude ordinary NaN
  propagation).

### Optimisation

- **MT-F16 — Hyperbolic scratch data physically lives inside `_tanhf`'s
  block, so `_sinhf`/`_coshf` alone pull in the whole `_tanhf` body via
  `dccrtlstrip` transitivity.** Public boundaries `:17862,17909,17955`;
  scratch `:18058-18063`. Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** move the
  shared `__hyp_*` scratch to a dedicated shared prelude/data block, or use
  per-routine scratch. **Measure:** stripped/`.COM` size for sinh-only and
  cosh-only probes; confirm `ntvcm -p` unaffected.
- **MT-F17 — `tanf` performs an unreachable denominator-zero comparison.**
  `:18691-18705`. Confidence: high. Prior reduction guarantees `|r|≤π/4`,
  making `15-6r²` always ≥ 11.29 (never zero, and NaN also compares
  false), so the `__feqf`+dead-branch is unreachable. **Measure:** repeated
  `tanf` `ntvcm -p`; stripped/assembled size.
- **MT-F18 — `modff` calls the general `floorf`/`ceilf` plus a subtraction
  on every call where a direct exponent/mantissa mask would do.**
  `:19883-19944`. Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** construct the
  integral part via exponent/mantissa masks; return directly for `|x|<1`
  and `|x|≥2²³`, reserving subtraction for the middle range. **Measure:**
  focused `modff` `ntvcm -p`, stripped lines, `.COM` bytes.

### Batch 8 execution results

Executed from exact base `83e2ce12e7e608399e5f51d20336ecdced339526`
in the isolated `build/b8-arith-float` worktree. Measurements and the
reproducible peep/nopeep probe harness are under `build/b8-measurements/` and
`build/b8-probes/`; generated artifacts are intentionally ignored.

- **LA-F2 accepted, with a profitability boundary.** Wide div/mod pairing now
  runs after object promotion has exposed the real declared operand types,
  only within one basic block and without an intervening call. One `__lds` or
  `__ldu` call produces both results; public stripped-runtime aliases
  `__lrlo`/`__lrhi` expose the remainder, and signed remainder correction
  follows the dividend sign. `LAFUSE`, against a correct no-fusion compiler,
  fell from 4,872,208 to 2,689,288 cycles peep and 4,875,940 to 2,693,020
  nopeep (both -2,182,920), with `.COM` 3,584 to 3,456 bytes and exact
  `RTLMIN` end `0A6F` to `09DE`. The `tpi` exact schedule fell from
  88,617,879 to 63,418,405 peep and 89,342,929 to 64,143,455 nopeep
  (both -25,199,474), with unchanged 2,816-byte `.COM` and `RTLMIN` end
  `08C5`. `tldmfus` adds signed, unsigned, reversed-order, negative-remainder,
  and high-bit coverage (8 checks, zero failures). A broader cross-call
  pairing experiment was rejected: it made stack-check `tmuldiv` nopeep grow
  8,832 to 8,960 bytes despite its cycle win. The no-intervening-call gate
  removes that regression; final `tmuldiv` is 8,832 bytes in both modes.
  Repairing all div/mod widths was also rejected after full regression found
  unsigned 16-bit `rand()%constant` had become signed; repair is deliberately
  limited to 32-bit operations, restoring `tstr` byte-for-byte to the base
  compiler output.
- **LA-F3/LA-F4/LA-F6 accepted.** Divider output initialization now follows
  the 16-bit-divisor dispatch, three dead carry clears are gone, and five
  redundant `ld sp,ix` restores are removed. `LAD16` improved by 50,400
  cycles in each mode and `LAD32` by 95,760, with unchanged 2,944-byte
  `.COM` files; exact `RTLMIN` end moved `0954` to `0949`.
- **LA-F5 accepted.** `__lmul` uses balanced stack storage instead of writable
  result scratch. `LAMUL` improved by 10,000 cycles in each mode, retained its
  2,688-byte `.COM`, and moved exact `RTLMIN` end `08CB` to `08B7`.
- **LA-F7 accepted.** Unsigned long comparison boolean materialization is
  shorter. `LACMP` improved by 11,000 cycles in each mode with unchanged
  2,944-byte `.COM`; exact `RTLMIN` end moved `08A0` to `0896`.
- **LA-F8 accepted.** `__m1mu` skips eight empty high-byte iterations for a
  byte-sized multiplier and keeps the modulus in `BC` at every loop edge.
  Against the pre-change runtime, `M1MUL` improved by 578,967 cycles,
  `tm1mu` by 24,962,763, and `pihex` by 233,003,475 in each mode, without
  `.COM` growth or output changes.
- **FC-F6/FC-F7 accepted.** The predicates use zero/exponent/sign identities,
  and `_fabsf` clears the sign bit inline. `FCMP` improved by 66,066 cycles
  in each mode (peep `.COM` 6,400 to 6,272); `FABSF` improved by 27,000 in
  each mode with unchanged 4,736-byte `.COM`. Existing special-value and
  rounding workloads remained bit-exact.
- **MT-F17 confirmed already present at the base tip.** Reverse-restoring the
  unreachable denominator-zero comparison cost 41,130 cycles in each mode,
  grew `.COM` 6,272 to 6,400 bytes, and moved exact `RTLMIN` end `1730` to
  `1794`, with identical output. No source change was needed.
- **MT-F18 accepted.** `_modff` now handles signed zero, `|x|<1`, `|x|>=2^23`,
  infinities, and NaNs directly and masks the middle-range mantissa before
  the one required subtraction. `MODFF` improved by 1,467,520 cycles in each
  mode; peep `.COM` fell 4,480 to 3,968 and nopeep 4,608 to 4,224, with exact
  `RTLMIN` ends `0EC1` to `0D27` and `0F7B` to `0DE1`. `tmodfsp` adds 38
  bit-exact signed-zero, subnormal, mask-boundary, infinity, and NaN checks.

Validation used the worktree runtime explicitly in every build. Both strict
full+extended stack-check and no-stack regressions passed (389 run, 10
skipped, zero failures in each mode pair), as did the focused peep/nopeep
tests, final stack/no-stack MIR censuses (no missing MIR selections),
ASan/UBSan affected-app compiles, Python and MIR script tests, runtime
coverage (404 public labels reconciled, zero unexpected), IY safety, stripper
EQU/block tests, and an assembled 1,451-`JR` range audit. The new remainder
aliases survived stripping and linked in both optimized and unoptimized
`tldmfus`; stack/register ABI checks passed throughout.

### Batch 9 integration results

Integrated from exact base `3508d133ebb569eb99c26a039db244ed45889b0b`
in the detached `build/b9-integrated` worktree. The three submitted artifact
sets and their hashes/manifests were verified before semantic merging.

- **CI-1/CI-8 completed with bounded, non-overlapping storage.** A 127-byte
  CP/M tail containing one-character arguments separated by tabs has
  `2*n-1 <= 127`, hence at most 64 tail arguments. With 16-bit pointers the
  vector is exactly `(argv[0] + 64 arguments + NULL) * 2 = 132` bytes, and the
  copied tail is `127 + NUL = 128` bytes. The compiler reserves the contiguous
  half-open scratch range `[__bsse,__hstart)` with `__hstart=__bsse+260`;
  vector `[__bsse,__bsse+132)` and tail copy
  `[__bsse+132,__hstart)` therefore cannot overlap each other, C BSS
  `[__bssb,__bsse)`, the heap starting at `__hstart`, or the stack reserve
  validated above it. Before accepting any heap limit, startup now rejects
  unsigned `__hstart < __bsse`; the generated near-64K BSS regression proves
  rejection at `__bsse=0xFEFC`, while boundary checks prove `0xFEFB` remains
  valid. `targlim` checks the normal addresses, 16-bit pointer width,
  program-name slot, empty/repeated terminators, exact 63/64 tab-separated
  capacities, and deterministic 128/255 length clamping.
- **CI-6/CI-9 completed.** `_setvbuf` rejects nonzero mode high bytes with
  `EINVAL`; `_strerror` rejects wide and negative low-byte aliases. Focused
  `tsvbmod` and `terrwid` pass in peep/nopeep modes.
- **CI-7 completed without ABI replacement.** `bios()` and `bioshl()` retain
  their two-argument source, stack, fastcall, and return conventions.
  `biosreg(fn,bcarg,dearg)` is a separate ordinary C stack-ABI block that
  independently restores BC/DE, tail-dispatches through the BIOS table, and
  returns HL. `tbiosrg` verifies A, C, BC, HL, SELDSK, SECTRAN, direct-call,
  and function-pointer forms; stripper tests prove `_biosreg` and the
  convenience wrappers do not retain one another. Existing `tbios` remains
  byte-identical; the revision-wide startup recovery improves it by four
  cycles in each mode without changing the BIOS paths.
- **SM-F2/LA-F1/LA-F9 completed.** The 27-check `tdivzero` test covers every
  signed/unsigned 16/32-bit standalone and fused zero-divisor path, high-bit
  operands, `__m1mu`, and `LONG_MIN/-1`. Ordinary zero-divisor paths expose an
  all-ones quotient and original-dividend remainder; a discriminating
  `0x8001*3` case fixes `__m1mu`'s specialized sentinel at `low16(a*b)`.
  `LONG_MIN/-1` remains documented undefined C behavior with DCC's
  two's-complement wrap and zero remainder; no trap/saturation branch was added.
- **Cumulative size was recovered rather than baselined away.** Moving the
  260-byte argv/tail scratch above BSS removes loaded storage and BSS-clear
  cycles. The wrap check is offset by emitting the absolute BSS byte count,
  using `__hstart` directly as the fixed heap base, and making the accepted
  heap-limit path fall through. Full-runtime CSEG moved `82B3h -> 8278h`
  (-59 bytes) despite all
  Batch 9 features; the argument-startup probe moved `02D4h -> 024Eh`
  (-134 exact runtime bytes), `.COM` 1024 -> 896, with +132 cycles. The
  main(void) strip control remains byte-identical and improves by four cycles.
  Only the revised new/direct `tdivzero` performance row was regenerated.

Final validation passed the canonical build, focused peep/nopeep tests,
30 Python tests, 31 dccpeep fixtures, strict MkDocs, IY safety, runtime
coverage (173/173 mapped APIs, 404 public labels, zero unexpected), full
runtime assembly, and all 1,452 `JR` displacements. Both strict full+extended
stack and no-stack suites found 405 apps: 395 passed, 10 skipped, zero failed;
diagnostics, dccpeep, extended tests, and the checked performance run passed.

### Batch 10 integrated results

Implemented from exact base `576fb53a4fe97b8ac41734f75f555749dcf0f0a5`
in detached worktree `build/b10-integrated`.

- **XM-C1 completed.** `strtol` and `strtoul` recognize `0x`/`0X` only when a
  hexadecimal digit follows. Bare and incomplete prefixes convert the leading
  zero, leave `endptr` at `x`/`X`, and do not change `errno`.
- **XM-C2/XM-C3 completed.** The fixed single-byte execution encoding accepts
  only `wchar_t` values through `0x00FF`. `wctomb` returns `-1` before writing
  an unrepresentable value; `wcstombs` returns `(size_t)-1` without storing its
  truncated low byte, while any representable prefix may remain.
- **XM-C4 completed with one 127-byte staged payload.** `exec()` validates and
  copies through NUL/CR into private exec-owned scratch before open, stack
  abandonment, high-memory writes, FCB clearing, or destination copying.
  `execv()` builds into the same staged representation. `__xsctl` copies the
  authoritative 0..127 length to `0081h..00FFh`; CR is omitted only at exactly
  127 bytes. A 128th text byte returns `-1` with `errno=E2BIG`.
- **XM-R3 completed without a quoting protocol.** The existing direct CP/M
  parser treats bytes through ASCII space as delimiters and quote/backslash as
  literals. Giving quote or backslash a new escape meaning would change direct
  invocation, while a private marker would be an ABI/protocol extension.
  `execv()` therefore rejects empty or delimiter-containing arguments with
  `EINVAL`; representable quote/backslash arguments remain byte-exact.
- **XM-R1 completed with bounded CP/M syntax.** `__xacom` accepts only an
  unambiguous CP/M 2.2 file reference: optional A: through P:, 1..8 primary
  bytes, optional 1..3 filetype bytes, and none of CP/M's forbidden component
  characters. Extensionless names receive `.COM`; the maximum drive-qualified
  result is 14 bytes plus NUL in the 16-byte `__xpbuf`. `__xwcp` writes at most
  15 bytes plus NUL and scans only within the authoritative tail length.
  Default FCB parsing uses every byte through ASCII space as a delimiter,
  matching startup for spaces, tabs, and control whitespace.
- **XM-R2 completed with a record-exact preflight.** After open and before
  changing SP, BDOS function 35 supplies `R2:R1:R0`. Nonzero R2 cannot fit the
  16-bit TPA. For the remaining count, `__xfit` computes
  `floor((FBASE-80-16-0100h)/128)` and rejects larger images. The approved
  count is embedded in the 44-byte trampoline, which performs exactly that
  many successful sequential reads, warm-boots on any early nonzero status,
  and never reads a grown extra record. SP is placed at `FBASE-80`; protected
  ranges are stack `[F-96,F-80)`, FCB `[F-80,F-44)`, and trampoline
  `[F-44,F)`.
- **Errors are deterministic.** Invalid paths set `EINVAL`, failed opens set
  `ENOENT`, unsafe record-rounded images set `EFBIG`, oversized tails set
  `E2BIG`, and unrepresentable `execv` arguments set `EINVAL`.
- **Coverage is 8.3-safe, structural, and emulated.** `tconv10`, `texargs`, and
  `texbnd08` cover the conversion, command-tail, argument, path, and synthetic
  loader boundaries without sharing persistent state. `test_exec_loader_safety.py`
  exhaustively compares the helper formula with exact half-open ranges for all
  65,536 FBASE values and checks the function-35-before-SP instruction order,
  record shifts, 128-byte DMA trampoline, and bounded path/word-copy structure.
- **The blocking review revision is covered directly.** `texargs` exercises a
  caller-local tail, a source beginning at `0080h`, and a source spanning the
  default FCB/DMA boundary; accepts exact 127-byte `exec` and `execv` payloads;
  rejects 128 bytes; checks payload byte 127 at `00FFh`; and verifies FCB1/FCB2
  bytes after tab/control delimiters. Structural tests exhaust all FBASE
  values, enforce scratch block ownership, and model early failure, exact
  completion, and post-preflight growth.
- **The cumulative result remains smaller than the independent slices.**
  Full-runtime CSEG is `8278h -> 83B6h`, +318 bytes, which is 24 bytes below
  the +342 sum of the three input slices despite the review hardening.
  Exact-base `texec` retains +279 RTLMIN bytes and +256 COM bytes;
  `texecdp` retains +283 RTLMIN bytes and +256 COM bytes. Unrelated
  `main(void)` and `mblen` controls remain byte- and cycle-identical.
- **Exact measurements preserve generated application code and output.**
  Base/final application MAC and target-output hashes match throughout the
  matrix. Exact-base `texec` improves by 402 cycles in both modes because the
  approved-count trampoline no longer performs an EOF probe; `texecdp` is
  +7,884 cycles. Conversion deltas remain +46 RTLMIN bytes for
  `strtol`/`strtoul`, -6 for `wctomb`, and -1 for `wcstombs`.
- **Final validation passed.** Canonical build, 41 Python tests, 31 dccpeep
  fixtures, strict MkDocs, IY safety, runtime coverage (407 public labels,
  zero unexpected; 173 mapped APIs and 196 standard APIs fully covered), full
  runtime assembly, and all 1,489 `JR` displacements passed. Both strict
  full+extended stack and no-stack suites found 408 apps: 398 passed, 10
  skipped, zero failed; diagnostics, dccpeep, extended tests, and checked
  performance passed.

The exact matrix and hashes are in
`build/b10-integrated-measurements.tsv`,
`build/b10-integrated-report.md`, and
`build/b10-integrated-sha256.tsv`.

### Sub-ranges only spot-checked rather than formally exhausted

`:17185-17364` (`expf` coefficients), `:17435-17592` (`logf` coefficients),
`:18202-18500` (`sinf`/`cosf` coefficients), `:18890-18990` (`atanf`
coefficients), `:19343-19554` (`asinf` coefficients) — Horner-scheme
push/pop staging was checked but not exhaustively re-derived
coefficient-by-coefficient; the preceding float core (Section 10) was not
re-audited here, only its documented helper/signed-zero contract was relied
upon.

## Section 12 — Generated `strtol`/`strtoul`/`strtok` + env/locale/multibyte + `exec`

`DCCRTL.MAC:21173-22639`: the strconv.c-derived block (`sc_isspace,
sc_isdigit,__stol,__stou,__stok`), `_getenv/_system/_mblen/_mbtowc/_wctomb/
_mbstowcs/_wcstombs`, and `_exec/_execv/__xmain` plus its scratch data.

**Known, deliberately-deferred pattern — seen and correctly skipped:** the
documented dead `or a` carry-clear codegen habit in the generated strconv
block (e.g. `:20381`) was identified and correctly *not* re-reported, per
the in-file comment explaining it's a general dcc-codegen habit deferred to
a future compiler-side fix.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** the already-fixed `strtol`→`modff`
strip-block coupling is confirmed present/fixed; the already-fixed
failed-exec caller-stack-corruption low-memory precheck (`:20891-20911`) is
present; ordinary overflow clamps/sign handling, `strtok`, `getenv`,
`mblen`, and `mbtowc`/`mbstowcs` were traced correctly.

### Correctness

- **XM-C1 — fixed in the Batch 10 conversion slice.** `strtol`/`strtoul`
  formerly mishandled a bare/incomplete `0x` prefix.
  `__stox_core` (`:20130-20500`); generated-source counterpart
  `src/apps/strconv/strconv.c:61-126`. Confidence: high. `strtol("0xG",
  &end,0)` formerly consumed `0x` then found no hex digit and reset `end`
  back to `nptr`, instead of the correct partial conversion (value `0`,
  `end` pointing at `'x'`); the same happened for bare `"0x"`.
  **Resolution:** the prefix is recognized only when a hexadecimal digit
  follows; the generated source and optimized hand-copy remain in sync.
- **XM-C2 — fixed in the Batch 10 conversion slice.** `wctomb` formerly
  accepted wide characters it could not represent.
  `_wctomb` (`:20740-20759`). Confidence: high. With `MB_CUR_MAX==1`, a
  nonzero high byte (e.g. `0x0100`, `0x0141`) is not representable.
  **Resolution:** when `s!=NULL`, the function rejects it with `-1` before
  storing anything; the `s==NULL` state query remains zero.
- **XM-C3 — fixed in the Batch 10 conversion slice.** `wcstombs` formerly
  silently truncated an unrepresentable wide string instead of returning
  `(size_t)-1`. `_wcstombs`
  (`:20805-20843`). Confidence: high. `{0x0141,0}` formerly became `"A"`;
  `{0x0100,0}` was mistaken for an empty string because only the low byte of
  each `wchar_t` was examined. **Resolution:** both bytes are checked before
  each write; only an all-zero value terminates, and a nonzero high byte
  returns `(size_t)-1` without writing the offending element.
- **XM-C4 — fixed in Batch 10.** `exec` validates and stages the complete raw
  tail through NUL/CR before any loader side effect, and `execv` accounts for
  every separator and argument byte before writing. Both accept 127 text bytes
  and reject a 128th with `E2BIG`; `__xsctl` copies the authoritative 0..127
  length to `0081h..00FFh` and omits CR only when no byte remains.
- **XM-C5 — `system()`'s header documentation contradicts the runtime's
  actual (correct) behavior.** `_system` (`:20635-20655`) vs.
  `stdlib.h:84-85`. Confidence: high. The runtime correctly returns `0` for
  `system(NULL)`; the header comment claims it "always returns -1". **Fix
  direction:** correct the header documentation; do not change the runtime.

### Robustness

- **XM-R1 — fixed in Batch 10.** `__xacom` validates an optional A: through P:
  drive prefix, a 1..8-byte primary name, an optional 1..3-byte filetype, and
  CP/M 2.2's unambiguous-name character rules before copying. Its longest
  output is 14 bytes plus NUL. `__xwcp` writes at most 15 bytes plus NUL and
  advances only within the staged length to a delimiter byte `<=20h`.
- **XM-R2 — fixed in Batch 10.** After open and before changing SP, `__xmain`
  calls BDOS function 35 and validates the complete three-byte record count.
  For FBASE `F`, an `n`-record image writes the exact half-open DMA range
  `[0100h,0100h+n*128)` and is accepted only when its end is at or below
  `F-96`. The protected half-open ranges are stack gap `[F-96,F-80)`, FCB
  `[F-80,F-44)`, and trampoline `[F-44,F)`. SP starts at `F-80`; setup uses at
  most 10 of the 16 stack bytes. The approved count is patched into the
  trampoline, which performs exactly `n` successful reads, warm-boots on an
  early nonzero status, and ignores records added after preflight.
- **XM-R3 — fixed in Batch 10 without changing direct invocation.** The CP/M
  startup parser still treats bytes through ASCII space as delimiters and
  keeps quote/backslash literal. `execv` therefore rejects empty or
  delimiter-containing arguments with `EINVAL`; representable quote and
  backslash arguments round-trip byte-for-byte.

### Optimisation

- **XM-O1 — fixed in Batch 8.** The former `strtol`/`strtoul` NULL-`endptr`
  test performed an unnecessary 32-bit comparison (and a dead `ld de,0`
  before an `ex de,hl`) where a direct 16-bit `H|L` test and store would do. `SCL93`
  (`:20458-20484`). Confidence: high. **Measure:** linked size and
  `ntvcm -p` for NULL/non-NULL `endptr`.
- **XM-O2 — fixed in Batch 8.** `_system` formerly built an unneeded IX frame
  for a function that only reads one stack argument. `:20640-20655`.
  Confidence: high.
  **Measure:** `_system`-only linked size; `ntvcm -p` per call.
- **XM-O3 — fixed in Batch 8.** Successful `exec` formerly recomputed an
  already-correct SP a second time. Initial setup (`:20921-20925`), redundant
  recompute (`:20966-20971`). Confidence: high. **Measure:** exec-core size and
  successful-exec setup `ntvcm -p`.
- **XM-O4 — fixed in Batch 8.** `__xclfb`'s clear loop formerly reloaded `A=0`
  on every one of its 16 iterations instead of once before the loop.
  `:21121-21127`. Confidence: high. **Measure:** exec-setup `ntvcm -p` and size.
- **XM-O5 — Multibyte-stub scratch counters are retained by every
  multibyte function even when only one (e.g. `mblen` alone) is used**,
  because they sit in the shared consecutive-`public` prelude.
  `:20661-20667`. Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** move each counter
  into its owning conversion's own block, or eliminate the static counters
  entirely. **Measure:** stripped/`.COM` size for a one-multibyte-function
  program.

---

## Section 13 — `atoi`/`atof`/`strtod` + `exit`/`atexit`/`abort`/`assert` + `signal`/`locale`/time/calendar

`DCCRTL.MAC:5642-6663` (`_exit,_atexit,_abort,__asfl,__cpm_set_retcode,
__stchk,_atoi,_atol,_atof,_strtod,_fflush` + stdio globals) and
`:21194-22651` (`_signal,_raise,_setlocale,_clock,_time,_difftime,
_strftime`, and the generated calendar block `_gmtime/__ltim/_asctime/
_ctime/_mktime`).

**Known, deliberately-deferred pattern — seen and correctly skipped:** the
documented dead `sbc hl,de` (in `cal_days_in_month`'s prologue) and dead
`or a`-before-`pop bc/add hl,bc` carry-clears in the generated calendar
block (`:21492-21500` and throughout) were identified and correctly *not*
re-reported, per the in-file comment deferring this to a future
compiler-side fix.

**Checked correct, not re-reported:** `_atexit` correctly caps registration
at 32 (returns nonzero on a 33rd) and dispatches LIFO; `_abort`/`__asfl`
bypass atexit handlers and don't return, with assertion-message formatting
matching `assert.h`; `__stchk` correctly accepts `SP==__hlimit` (prior
sign/boundary bugs already fixed); the previously-documented
`atoi("+...")` bug is fixed; leap-year logic correctly implements the
`%4`/`%100`/`%400` rule, the month-length table is correct, and
`(days+4)%7` correctly gives Thursday for 1970-01-01; the documented CP/M
signal degeneracy, fixed-"C" locale, and timezone-free `localtime==gmtime`
equivalence are internally consistent, not bugs.

### Correctness

- **EC-F1 — `_strftime`'s `public` declaration and its function body are in
  two different `dccrtlstrip` blocks — a `strftime`-only program fails to
  link.** Declaration `:21301`; body actually lives inside the `_mktime`
  block starting at `:21722` (the block whose public-run *ends* at
  `_gmtime`, line 21550, is what `dccrtlstrip` associates with the
  `_strftime` declaration, per `src/dccrtlstrip/dccrtlstrip.c:663-770`).
  Confidence: high. A program that calls `strftime()` but not `mktime()`
  keeps the declaration but not the body, producing an undefined-symbol
  link failure; existing tests likely mask this by also exercising
  `mktime`. **This is exactly the class of `dccrtlstrip` block-boundary
  regression the review was asked to watch for.** **Fix direction:** move
  `public _strftime` immediately before its actual body (or move the body
  beside the declaration); add a standalone `strftime`-only strip/link
  regression test.
- **EC-F2 — fixed in Batch 11.** `_mktime` now range-checks normalized days
  and seconds before multiplying, rejects the complete unsigned-32-bit edge
  and its wrap successor, copies the normalized `struct tm` only after a
  signed `time_t` result is proved, and preserves an unrelated shared
  `gmtime`/`localtime` result.
- **EC-F3 — fixed in Batch 11.** `atof`/`strtod` combine the full explicit
  exponent with fractional and skipped-integer digit counts before clamping
  the final effective exponent, preserving large exact cancellations.
- **EC-F4 — fixed in Batch 11.** `_strftime` is a bounded fixed-C-locale
  interpreter for every C89 conversion available from `struct tm`, plus the
  documented `%C` century extension. It always reserves the terminating NUL
  and returns `0` on insufficient space. Malformed formats and invalid fields
  follow the deterministic policy documented in `time.h`; its private tables
  remain in a standalone strip block.
- **EC-F5 — fixed in Batch 11.** `time()` validates packed BCD and checks
  CP/M day 21934 against `03:14:07` before arithmetic; the following second
  and all later dates return/store `-1`.
- **EC-F6 — fixed in Batch 11.** `strtod` consumes the private range status
  from `atof`, sets `ERANGE` for numeric overflow/underflow, and leaves
  `errno` unchanged for explicit infinity/NaN and exact zero.
- **EC-F7 — fixed in Batch 11.** `atoi` and `atol` skip space and every byte
  from `0x09` through `0x0d`, with each routine retaining only its own
  conversion block.
- **EC-F8 — fixed in Batch 11.** Month, civil-day, and signed clock offsets
  are combined before lower/upper range checks, so both month- and day-based
  crossings into 1970 normalize consistently.

### Robustness

- **EC-F9 — fixed in Batch 11.** `_difftime` detects signed subtraction
  overflow, converts the wrapped low 32 bits as an unsigned magnitude, and
  applies the mathematical sign after conversion.
- **EC-F10 — fixed in Batch 11.** `_asctime` rejects bad weekday/month/date/
  clock/year fields before any write, emits exactly 25 characters plus NUL,
  and leaves its static buffer unchanged on failure.

### Optimisation

- **EC-F11 — Shared calendar helpers/tables are split across the wrong
  `dccrtlstrip` blocks, so `gmtime` alone drags in `_mktime` and then even
  `_difftime`.** `CDZ0001` in `_difftime`'s block (`:21505-21548`);
  `CDZ0002`/`CDZ0004` and tables inside the large `_mktime` block
  (`:22223-22638`). Confidence: high. **Fix direction:** give shared
  calendar helpers/data their own dedicated internal public blocks, and
  separate the asctime-only tables out. **Measure:** minimal
  `gmtime`/`localtime`/`asctime`-only `.COM` size and `ntvcm -p` before/after.
- **EC-F12 — fixed in Batch 8.** `localtime` now tail-jumps directly into
  `gmtime` instead of building/tearing down its own IX frame around an
  identical call. `__ltim` (`:21583-21594`). Confidence: high. **Measure:** `.COM` bytes and
  `ntvcm -p` on a repeated-`localtime` microbenchmark.
- **EC-F13 — fixed in Batch 11 after its Batch 8 variant was rejected.**
  `_asctime` now emits validated fixed decimal/name fields directly. The
  asctime-only runtime no longer retains `sprintf`; combined retention was
  remeasured with the EC-F10 safety checks in place.

## Cross-cutting: `dccrtlstrip` public-block-boundary findings

The user's stripper clarification (`DCCRTL.MAC` is split into blocks by
`public` labels; `dccrtlstrip` keeps a block only if something reachable
references a symbol in it) turned out to matter concretely — **one finding
is a real, confirmed link-failure bug** (EC-F1), and several optimisation
findings are specifically about block placement causing unwanted transitive
retention. Collected here for visibility since they cut across sections:

| Finding | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **EC-F1** | `_strftime`'s declaration and body are in *different* blocks — **a `strftime`-only program fails to link.** Correctness, not just size. |
| **CT-F14** | `NTMP`/`TN_NSZ` constants live in `_fclose`'s block but are used by `_close`/`_tmpfile`, which don't depend on `_fclose`. |
| **MT-F16** | Hyperbolic scratch data lives inside `_tanhf`'s block, so `sinhf`/`coshf` alone drag in all of `_tanhf`. |
| **EC-F11** | Shared calendar helpers/tables are split across `_difftime`'s and `_mktime`'s blocks, so `gmtime` alone drags in `_mktime` and `_difftime`. |
| **CI-12** | `ungetc`'s pushback state lives inside `__fgetc`'s block, so plain `getchar` drags in the whole file-I/O core. |
| **XM-O5** | Multibyte-conversion scratch counters sit in a shared prelude, so any one multibyte function retains all of them. |
| **SM-F1** | Several fastcall entries jump into a *following* general-call block's private core, so the (unreachable-from-fastcall) general-call prologue is retained anyway. |
| **SM-F8** | The fused-divmod result cache lives inside `__udivmod`'s block, so direct fused-only callers retain it unused. |
| **SS-O4** | Making `__q2u` a true alias of `D16U` (rather than call+ret) would move a public entry label. |

**Recommendation for the future fix pass:** treat **EC-F1** as a correctness
fix (any severity/urgency label), and treat the rest as a batch of
"`dccrtlstrip` block-hygiene" optimisations that should be measured together
(stripped-`RTLMIN.MAC` line count and linked `.COM` size for minimal
single-feature programs, before/after) since they're all the same class of
fix and share the same validation approach.

## Meta-finding: `scripts/audit-runtime-coverage.py` needs updating

Confirmed in the baseline check at the top of this report and refined by the
printf-engine section (which additionally identified 5 of the 16
unaccounted labels as apparently untested by the default Linux runner path).
This script is a valuable guardrail (it caught real drift here) but needs
its static label lists refreshed to match the runtime's current formatted-
I/O surface. Recommended as a quick, low-risk, high-value first fix
independent of everything else in this report.

## Full list of "checked and explicitly not re-reported" items

Every section's sub-agent was instructed to check the three prior runtime
audit docs and the two known-deferred codegen patterns before reporting, to
avoid re-litigating settled ground. In addition to what's noted inline in
each section above, the following were explicitly re-verified as still
correct/still-fixed during this pass: the `__lmu` zero-interior-byte fix
(Section 7); `clearerr`/`ferror` functionality (Sections 2 and 8);
`memmove`/bounded-division/`memchr` optimisations (Section 3); `qsort`/
`bsearch` non-reentrancy and `abs`/`labs` signed-overflow semantics (Section
4); `pf_div10`/`pf_build_u`/`pf_divu32_10` (Section 5); the read-cache
invalidation fixes and `NFILES`/`UGC_MAX` sizing (Section 6); `_ldiv`'s
remainder reuse (Section 4); `setjmp`/`longjmp`'s IY save/restore (Section
9); the recent float-predicate optimisation commit (Section 10); several
already-documented math special-value fixes (Section 11); the `strtol`→
`modff` strip coupling and failed-exec stack-corruption precheck (Section
12); `_atexit`'s 32-registration cap/LIFO order, `__stchk`'s boundary
handling, and leap-year/weekday calculation correctness (Section 13). The
two deliberately-deferred dead-code codegen patterns (dead `or a`
carry-clears in the generated strconv/calendar blocks, and the calendar
block's one dead `sbc hl,de`) were seen and correctly excluded from every
section that touches those blocks.

## Recommended next steps (for a future, separate fix-implementation pass)

This audit intentionally made **no code changes**. Suggested order of
attack for a follow-up session:

1. **Fix `scripts/audit-runtime-coverage.py`'s label lists** (cheap, restores
   a guardrail, no runtime risk).
2. **Fix the handful of highest-confidence, self-contained correctness bugs
   with the smallest blast radius first**, each gated by the normal full
   regression suite in both `peep`/`nopeep`: **EC-F1** (`strftime` link
   failure — add a standalone regression first, since existing tests
   apparently mask it), **SJ-F1** (`sc_get_file` clobbers B — likely breaks
   real programs using `fscanf`/`scanf` with literal text today), **CT-F1**
   (`_fseek` result), **SH-F1** (`realloc` lost carry), **SS-C1** (`qsort`
   pointer underflow).
3. **Then the float-core subnormal defect (FC-F2)** — this is the most
   invasive fix (touches add/mul/div/scale/sqrt) and the highest-value one;
   budget real design time for it and add dedicated subnormal regression
   tests (`tests/` already has good raw-bit float test precedent to follow,
   e.g. `tfmodfsp.c`, `tfmedge.c`).
4. **Printf/scanf buffer-safety fixes** (**PF-F2**, **PF-F3**, **PF-F1**,
   **SJ-F3**) — these affect any program doing real file-based formatted
   I/O or interleaved `fscanf`/`fgetc`.
5. **The `_ungetc`/pushback family** (**CI-2..CI-5**, **CT-F3**,**CT-F4**) as
   one coordinated fix, since they share a root cause and read paths.
6. **File-I/O correctness batch** (Section 6's `FI-*` findings) — largely
   independent of each other, can be tackled incrementally with per-bug
   regressions.
7. **`powf`/trig special-value batch** (Section 11's `MT-*` findings) —
   also largely independent per-function.
8. **`dccrtlstrip` block-hygiene batch** (table above) — do together, single
   measurement pass across minimal single-feature programs.
9. **Everything else** (remaining optimisations) — pick opportunistically;
   each must still be measured with `ntvcm -p` before/after per the
   project's "line count doesn't prove a win" rule, and every change of any
   kind must pass the strict full+extended regression gate
   (`DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1 DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_EMIT=1 pwsh
   ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode full -Extended -RunTimeout 30 -FailuresOnly`,
   both with and without `-NoStackCheck`) before it's considered done.
