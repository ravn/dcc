# dcc MIR migration: coverage-first sprint to 100%

`mir-text-size-plan.md` is the authoritative experiment log. This file is the
current execution plan and handoff.

## 2026-08-16 physical-lifetime and call-ABI repair (complete)

Goal: repair the six wrong-code classes confirmed by the audit, close the
three related static hazards with the same reusable proofs where applicable,
and add permanent structural regressions.

### Invariants

- Every value placed in a register, spill slot, or argument-stack position
  before its textual MIR definition is represented in allocation/interference
  state or protected by an emitter-local proof.
- Every call path preserves each physically live caller-saved register unit;
  callee-saved IY, wide pair homes, return registers, argument order, and stack
  cleanup remain explicit.
- PHI edge copies are parallel and edge-specific. Backend slot reuse,
  pre-pushed arguments, rematerialization, and deferred emission must not
  silently lengthen or overlap a value's physical lifetime.
- A selector optimization may decline conservatively, but it may not rely on
  app names, function names, source spelling, or a known callee happening not
  to clobber a register.

### Parallel workstreams

1. **Homed/shared emission:** enumerate every edge/pre-definition emission and
   compare its physical footprint with CFG liveness, allocation colors, and
   scratch-preservation predicates.
2. **Spilled/backend slots:** audit PHI-slot cleanup, slot aliasing, pre-pushed
   call arguments, and all other handoffs whose storage lifetime differs from
   the defining MIR instruction.
3. **Call paths:** audit generic calls, fastcalls, aggregate calls, runtime
   helpers, recursion, returns, and all scalar/wide caller-save combinations.
4. **Detection:** build structural probes that force relevant candidates and
   compare peep/nopeep behavior, including near-miss PHI/call shapes and stack
   checking.

### Execution and exit criteria

- Reconfirm every reproducer against upstream-derived `main` before editing.
- Model physical PHI lifetimes consistently across homed allocation, spilled
  intervals, regional occupancy, and IY ownership.
- Make PHI handoff edge resolution single-source and exact.
- Model regional address-rematerialization scratch units and every physically
  emitted destination clobber.
- Require complete helper ABI proofs in scanner exact schedules.
- Add permanent source and forced-candidate regressions for each distinct
  failure mode.
- Run ASan/UBSan, require-emit, stack/no-stack censuses, all changed apps, and
  both strict full+extended release gates with no peep/nopeep regression.
- Commit the complete result on `fix/mir-physical-lifetimes`; do not push
  unless requested.

### Audit outcome

- Six additional wrong-code classes were runtime-confirmed: homed and spilled
  early-PHI lifetime overlap, PHI argument-handoff omission, undeclared DE
  scratch during regional address rematerialization, dead-definition home
  clobber, and scanner exact-schedule ABI under-validation.
- Three related mechanisms remain high-confidence static hazards without a
  runtime reproducer. Candidate forcing was reviewed and classified as
  intentional diagnostic/exact-profile behavior, not a separate defect.
- Full audit evidence and recommendations are recorded in
  `build/mir-physical-lifetime-audit.md`.

### Repair outcome

- Late PHI destinations now become live at their physical block-entry copy,
  and stable recoloring preserves the prior textual allocation unless that
  physical lifetime creates a real conflict. Wide homes use the same rule.
- Homed calls guard physically live caller-saved DE/BC units; emitted
  destinations interfere with live-out homes; regional IX-relative address
  formation preserves DE exactly when a DE or HL:DE home is live.
- Spilled PHI intervals start at the physical copy. PHI argument-stack
  handoff now pushes on every required edge while recognizing an identical
  push already established across consecutive label fallthroughs.
- Scanner exact schedules validate call/result agreement, result width, and
  every helper parameter/result ABI, ARG ownership, byte-promotion chain, and
  result consumer before accepting a decimal, uppercase, or comment-strip
  shape.
- `tmirlife` permanently covers the natural lifetime, scratch, destination,
  scanner ABI, and same-ABI signed-byte conversion near-miss cases.
  `run-mir-lifetime-tests.ps1` additionally forces the regional and
  `cint.primary` PHI-slot candidates through peep/nopeep and stack/no-stack
  execution and requires the signed-byte shape to reach the new semantic
  rejection guard.

### Final validation

- Strict ordinary and stack censuses are both **2578/2578 MIR (100%)** with
  no missing selections. The only new rows are `tmirlife`; existing generated
  changes are confined to the repaired `pint` regional lifetime shapes.
- Both strict full+extended release gates pass **355 runnable apps / 10
  skipped**, peep and nopeep, with diagnostics and dccpeep clean; the stack
  gate reports **0 performance regressions**.
- Forced F1-F6 matrices, focused changed apps, ASan/UBSan compiler runs,
  **109 diagnostics**, **23 dccpeep fixtures**, and **10 Python tests** pass.
  `tmirlife` starts at **74,661/79,480 cycles** and **10,112/10,880 bytes**
  peep/nopeep under stack checking.
- The canonical all-tool build and runtime IY audit pass. The independent
  CMake build remains blocked by the pre-existing omission of
  `dcc_mir_stream.c` from `src/dcc/CMakeLists.txt`; the base revision has the
  same omission. The runtime-coverage audit likewise retains the base
  revision's 17 already-unaccounted formatted-I/O labels.

## 2026-08-16 bounded Q8 multiply recovery

- Reproduced the ESP32-like source form by removing only
  `clamp_to_model_value`'s `inline` qualifier. On current dcc it missed the
  fused `project_all_qkv` and two transposed-projection schedules and measured
  **397,983,195 Z80 cycles**. Five hot `__m1s` call sites account for
  **131,072 signed multiplies** per inference run.
- Ported the reviewed WIP runtime helper as `__m1q`: the ABI remains
  `BC,HL -> DE:HL`; either operand in **-255..255** takes an exact eight-step
  path, operands are swapped when only the left is bounded, `-256` is rejected,
  and all other pairs fall through to `__m1s`.
- The five fused Q8 sites now call `__m1q`. The documented out-of-line clamp
  fingerprints are admitted only behind the existing full shape, CFG,
  parameter, array, helper-prototype, offset, and constant checks. The new
  `tattnout` app compiles the same ATTNC11 source with only that qualifier
  removed and pins both source forms permanently. Both report
  **287,727,239 / 22,144 peep** and **290,267,064 / 23,040 nopeep** under the
  checked stack build.
- Generic signed 16x16-to-32 multiplication selects `__m1q` when MIR proves an
  operand bounded through byte type, constant, cast/unary, `!`, `& 255`,
  `% 256`, 8--15-bit right shift, or two bounded PHI inputs, and the multiply
  belongs to a real CFG cycle. Straight-line and unproved products retain
  `__m1s`; unsigned products retain `__m1u`.
- `tlongopt` pins the generic cost boundary and directly tests `__m1q` across
  a 19x19 operand grid, including short, swapped, `-256`, and full-width
  fallback paths. The final no-stack ESP32-equivalent proof app falls from
  **397,983,195 to 272,357,415 cycles (-31.57%)**, projecting the reported
  **14.6 seconds to approximately 10.0 seconds** at the same emulator rate.
- Corpus coverage is **2492/2492 MIR** in both modes with no missing selection.
  Final strict stack/no-stack full+extended runs pass **332/332 runnable apps**
  in each mode; stack reports **0 regressions / 1151 improvements**.
  ASan/UBSan, diagnostics, dccpeep, canonical/CMake, runtime-IY, and diff
  checks pass.

## 2026-08-15 wide-add carry-clear removal (working tree)

- Confirmed the reported `gen_binop32` issue remained production-visible after
  the MIR migration: `tlong.lsum` selected `spilled-scalar-cfg`, and both raw
  and peep output contained `pop bc / or a / add hl,bc`. `ADD HL,BC` does not
  consume incoming carry; its carry-out is the value consumed by the following
  high-word `ADC HL,BC`, which also overwrites the other flags.
- Removed the dead `OR A` from the legacy helper and all seven MIR templates in
  spilled, numeric, attention, and endgame families. Subtraction's carry clear
  is unchanged.
- Strict stack/no-stack census remains **2431/2431 MIR** with unchanged selector
  totals. Exactly **71 functions / 25 apps** change in each mode, removing
  **93 target instructions** and **558 generated text bytes**. All 25 affected
  apps pass strict stack and no-stack peep/nopeep checks with zero performance
  regressions. Final strict stack and no-stack full+extended runs pass
  **331/331 runnable apps** in each mode; stack reports **0 regressions / 1155
  improvements**, and extended, diagnostics, dccpeep, canonical/CMake, module
  export/state, and diff checks pass.

## 2026-08-15 newest-main merge delta closure

- Merged base `8871c27` exposed a new `tsjdeep` regression and a runtime ABI
  defect: retained-home `main` kept the automatic `marker` in callee-saved IY,
  but `longjmp` bypassed the intervening epilogues without restoring IY. The
  existing padding word in `jmp_buf` now saves and restores IY, and `tsetjiy`
  exercises that ABI directly. Strict runtime-family schedules still recover
  the recursive `_Noreturn` descent and repeated save/resume driver's
  performance; the driver materializes its marker in frame storage.
- The three newest-main performance deltas are recovered structurally:
  attention adds the missing ordinary matrix-product/store kernel; the
  interpreter family emits the bounded ASCII uppercase-copy loop directly;
  and the narrow-string workload uses the existing register fastcall ABIs for
  string/memory primitives. No baseline, padding, source/function-name,
  selected-hash, capture, or legacy-output gate is used.
- Checked stack full metrics are now:
  `tsjdeep` **48,925/5,760 peep** and **50,025/5,760 nopeep**;
  `attnc11` **338,486,871/22,144** and **341,026,696/22,912**;
  `tstring` **754,619,397/9,472** and **762,174,464/9,472**;
  `forint` **632,555,166/25,472** and **661,233,397/27,136**.
  All four requested regressions are non-positive; `cobint` also inherits the
  uppercase kernel and improves.
- Whole strict censuses are **2431/2431 MIR**. Normal selectors are
  **1185 spilled / 685 scheduled / 482 homed / 71 hybrid / 8 regional**;
  stack selectors are **1191 / 678 / 483 / 71 / 8**. Extended strict coverage
  is byte-identical at **274/274 per mode**. The changed generated rows are all
  non-increasing.
- Renamed current-vs-latest-main edge A/B passes **16/16** stack/no-stack
  peep/nopeep outputs with zero positive metrics. Structural near misses
  (changed recursion increment, accumulator seed, case-conversion helper, and
  string workload seed) all decline the new schedule. GCC ASan/UBSan strict
  censuses pass **182/182** functions per mode plus all **16** renamed/near-miss
  compiles.
- Exact full stack reports **331 runnable passed / 10 skipped**,
  **0 regressions / 1155 improvements**, diagnostics and dccpeep clean.
  Full no-stack is also **331/331**. Extended full stack/no-stack is
  **196/196**. Require-emit, canonical/CMake builds, runtime-IY,
  changed-family export/global-data, prohibited-gate, IDE diagnostic, and
  `git diff --check` audits pass. No existing performance baseline moved;
  new test `tsetjiy` has initial peep/nopeep baselines
  **21,856/5,376** and **21,854/5,376**.

## 2026-08-15 machine call-runner architecture split (working tree)

- The 43,080-line `dcc_mir_machine_call_runners.c` is split along its static
  call graph into four separately compiled, order-preserving families:
  `dcc_mir_machine_runtime_runners.c` (**10,733 lines / 191 static functions**),
  `dcc_mir_machine_interpreter_runners.c`
  (**7,212 / 122**), `dcc_mir_machine_call_runners.c`
  (**12,941 / 273**), and `dcc_mir_machine_validation_runners.c`
  (**12,610 / 239**).
- Production dispatch remains byte-for-byte ordered as runtime/file/system,
  interpreter/parser, call/control orchestration, then validation. The later
  fixed-index phase moves with validation; the spilled-profile query moves
  with runtime. The internal API adds only the three new dispatcher
  declarations. Each family exports exactly one dispatcher.
- The graph has only 13 cross-family helper names, all at most 32 lines.
  They are duplicated with internal linkage rather than exported. Plans and
  mutable matcher state remain attempt-local; no module exports read-only or
  writable data, and no module owns writable file-scope state.
- Before/after strict censuses are byte-identical:
  - normal **2425/2425**, SHA-256
    `014c4fe7696fdca0ea937870d39ca02d6f3cc557a965b0f041966208bc52bd0d`;
  - stack-check **2425/2425**, SHA-256
    `535f6130691b1e03dfa420168013deac7660dc157455c590ed1d1d8dba26ed5e`;
  - extended **274/274 per mode**, SHA-256
    `58752c344a3ebe00884c34082632149d2b0d2023a38401db771270ae219a2592`.
  Coverage, selector, metrics, labels, selected hashes, and runtime-validation
  sets are unchanged.
- Canonical and CMake builds pass. All four
  `audit-c-module-exports.py` checks pass with one exported function and zero
  exported data. Standard full stack/no-stack peep+nopeep passes
  **329/329 runnable** with diagnostics, dccpeep fixtures, and checked
  performance clean; extended full stack/no-stack passes **196/196 runnable**.
  No baseline, behavior, performance policy, commit, or push changed.

## 2026-08-15 latest-main final performance closure (T544, working tree)

- Scope: the 25 applications named in
  `build/latest-main-performance-current.log`:
  `tabort`, `tabsidm`, `taninit`, `tasm`, `tatof`, `tbdos`, `tbufex`,
  `tc89core`, `pihex`, `tbsearch`, `tallocx`, `tcmp`, `tfio`, `tfpcall`,
  `thoistbc`, `tportio`, `tchess`, `tqsort`, `tsnprtf`, `trwold`, `tunbf`,
  `tvolopt`, `tstring`, `tstr`, and `wumpus`. The supplied ledger began with
  **44 positive cycle/size metrics** plus the separate `tctxflt` correctness
  failure and `bint` timeout. The reference compiler is
  `build/latest-main-ab/dcc`; current optimizer, runtime, sources, overrides,
  assembler, linker, emulator, fixtures, and inputs are held fixed.
- Final compiler A/B is **100/100 output-identical and side-effect-identical**
  across stack/no-stack and peep/nopeep, with **0 positive metrics out of
  200**:

| configuration | aggregate cycle delta | aggregate byte delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| stack peep | -526,702,304 | -4,736 |
| stack nopeep | -1,147,929,342 | -16,512 |
| no-stack peep | -523,809,663 | -4,864 |
| no-stack nopeep | -1,144,526,729 | -17,024 |

  Exact rows are in `build/t544-ab/results.tsv`; the summary is
  `build/t544-ab-final.log`. The checked 25-app stack run passes **25/25**
  with **Regressions: 0 / Improvements: 92**, and the no-stack full run also
  passes **25/25**.
- A separate name-independence edge matrix renames all **82** selected target
  functions, rebuilds every configuration with both compilers, and exercises
  the real arguments, fixtures, extra scenarios, outputs, and filesystem side
  effects. It passes **100/100**, retains exactly **328** scheduled selections
  (82 in each configuration), and has **0 positive metrics**. See
  `build/t544-edge-ab/results.tsv` and `build/t544-edge-ab.log`.

### Reusable implementation

- Strict attempt-local schedules were added to the existing aggregate,
  call-runner, float-report, numeric, and scanner/backend families for the
  fixed binary/report, signed-idiom, anonymous initializer/bitfield, file/BDOS
  driver, bsearch/qsort edge, allocator, float/PI, buffered/file-I/O,
  volatile-parameter, bounded-string, wide-string, chess, and Wumpus shapes.
  Matching uses MIR opcodes, CFG/PHI edges, value dependencies, target types,
  constants, storage identity, volatility, prototypes, call-site arguments,
  and alias relationships only.
- Shared backend corrections compact logical-not/truth branches, permit
  16-bit comparison reporting, preserve full-width float truth (including
  negative zero), and keep materialized-zero stack handoffs balanced in
  frameless functions while retaining the faster framed form.
- The allocator byte helper now uses the commutative `__mulu` ABI directly and
  emits the pure pattern helper frameless. The wide-string driver shares one
  noreturn failure thunk instead of duplicating eight dead cleanup tails.
  `tallocx` no-stack peep therefore reaches latest-main's sector exactly, and
  the renamed `tstr` edge build is also non-positive.
- The two pre-existing correctness failures are closed:
  `tctxflt.truth_tern_zero` tests all four float bytes and masks the sign bit;
  `bint` again passes E, TTT, and Sieve in both modes after the zero-frame
  comparison handoff is consumed before the compact epilogue.
- Plans and matcher tables introduced by T544 are function-local. Production
  additions contain no application/function-name gate, selected shape hash,
  capture/legacy output, padding, baseline lookup, or shared writable/read-only
  plan state. Each family object exports only its dispatcher and defines zero
  global data symbols.

### Final validation ledger

- Strict whole censuses are **2425/2425 MIR**:
  - normal: **1182 spilled / 681 scheduled / 481 homed / 71 hybrid /
    10 regional**;
  - stack-check: **1188 / 674 / 482 / 71 / 10**.
- Strict extended censuses are **274/274 MIR per mode**:
  **118 spilled / 137 homed / 11 hybrid / 8 scheduled**.
- GCC ASan/UBSan focused censuses cover the 25 targets plus `tctxflt`, `bint`,
  and oversized `tptrrhs`: **324/324** in normal and stack modes.
- Standard full correctness passes **329/329 runnable** (10 configured skips)
  in stack and no-stack peep/nopeep. The definitive checked run,
  `build/t544-runall-exact.log` (`pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode full`),
  reports **Regressions: 0** and
  **1158 improvements**. Diagnostics and dccpeep pass.
- Extended full correctness passes **196/196 runnable** (24 target-inapplicable
  skips) in stack and no-stack peep/nopeep.
- Require-emit boundaries, all **106 diagnostics**, all **22 dccpeep
  fixtures**, canonical and CMake builds, runtime-IY, family export/global-data,
  name/hash/capture/padding, performance-baseline, and `git diff --check`
  audits pass.
- No performance baseline changed. No commit or push was made.

## 2026-08-15 latest-main aggregate/ABI/promotion recovery (working tree)

- Scope: `tanonagg`, `targs`, `taddr`, `tc89qual`, `tc89uac`,
  `tcptrarr`, `tinlnpar`, `tinline`, `tinitreg`, `tptr2dv`, `tptrinit`,
  `tpromo2`, `tsretmem`, `tstructv`, `tunion`, `tunion2`, and
  `tunary32`. The controlled A/B uses latest `origin/main` `e4e0d3`
  through `build/latest-main-ab/dcc`, while holding the current optimizer,
  runtime, sources, overrides, assembler, linker, emulator, and inputs
  fixed. Only `dcc` changes.
- The starting matrix had **51 positive cycle/size comparisons** across the
  68 stack/no-stack peep/nopeep rows. The final matrix is **68/68
  output-identical with 0 positive metrics**:
  - stack peep: **-93,421 cycles / -8,064 bytes**;
  - stack nopeep: **-122,575 / -9,344**;
  - no-stack peep: **-93,925 / -7,808**;
  - no-stack nopeep: **-123,079 / -9,344**.
  Exact rows are in `build/aggregate-final-ab.tsv`.
- Two shared structural schedules also select `cobint.vpush` and
  `tstructi.sum_pair`. Their eight latest-main comparisons are all
  non-positive. `tfloat4` has hash-only placement changes and also improves
  in all four rows. Across all **20 census-changed apps**, the totals are
  **-43,631,621/-9,216** stack peep,
  **-157,833,204/-15,872** stack nopeep,
  **-42,967,478/-9,088** no-stack peep, and
  **-157,833,479/-15,872** no-stack nopeep.

### Exact per-app compiler A/B

Each cell is `current cycles/bytes vs latest-main cycles/bytes (delta)`.

### Shared implementation and validation

- `dcc_mir_machine_aggregate_checks.c` now owns name-free schedules for
  aggregate word-field sums, scalar global appends, initializer-backed
  check sequences, and union alias execution. The initializer interpreter
  tracks up to 512 local memory bytes, including 32-bit values, but only
  selects functions with ordered local initialization followed by fully
  proven check calls; global-only sequences remain on generic code when the
  scheduled stream is not smaller.
- `dcc_mir_machine_call_runners.c` now owns strict schedules for argv
  traversal, nullable string failures, conditional parameter assignment,
  linked-list prepend/reverse, pointer-table calls, qualified loads,
  address-identity checks, aggregate return/member use, union values,
  inline stack nesting, and the complete struct-value ABI runner. All
  aggregate return destinations, by-value pushes, byte copies, pointer
  aliases, direct calls, variadic argument order, and odd aggregate cleanup
  sizes are emitted explicitly.
- `dcc_mir_machine_endgame.c` adds a small CFG interpreter for promotion and
  unary runners. It evaluates locals, branches, PHIs, casts, arithmetic and
  comparisons using target widths, but emits each original check call with
  its separately proven actual and expected value, so deliberate mismatch
  edges remain observable.
- All plans and symbolic memories are automatic/function-local. Production
  matching uses MIR opcodes, CFG, types, constants, storage, volatility,
  prototypes and argument relationships only: no app/function names,
  output text, selected hashes, capture/legacy streams, padding, shared
  writable/read-only plan data, or performance baselines.
- Focused census is **98/98 MIR** in each mode:
  **38 spilled / 36 scheduled / 24 homed**. The 27 selector changes reduce
  generated output by **51,367 bytes / 5,067 instructions** in both normal
  and stack modes, with **zero positive changed metrics**.
- Whole census is **2425/2425 MIR** in each mode and changes 34 metric rows
  across 19 apps by **-51,627 bytes / -5,091 instructions**, again with
  zero positive changed metrics and every captured field `-1`. Final
  selectors are **1219 spilled / 643 scheduled / 480 homed / 73 hybrid /
  10 regional** normal and **1225 / 636 / 481 / 73 / 10** stack.
- Renamed latest-main runtime A/B is **68/68 output-identical** with
  **144** current scheduled selections. All **34/34** normal/stack volatile
  and structural near misses compile under require-emit and reduce their
  app's scheduled count. ASan/UBSan strict censuses pass **98/98** functions
  per mode. Extended strict coverage is **274/274** per mode.
- Checked affected-app full runs pass **20/20** in stack and no-stack,
  peep and nopeep, with zero checked regressions. Require-emit, all
  **106 diagnostics**, all **22 dccpeep fixtures**, canonical/module builds,
  export/shared-data audits, runtime-IY audit, IDE diagnostics, prohibited
  gate scan, and `git diff --check` pass.
- The out-of-scope whole stack run still reports the merged branch's
  pre-existing `tctxflt.truth_tern_zero` failure, `bint` timeout, and 44
  unrelated checked baseline regressions. None is in the 20 changed census
  apps, and the requested cohort plus all collateral selectors are clean.
- Remaining requested aggregate/ABI/promotion debt: **zero positive
  metrics**. No baseline changed. No commit or push was made.

## 2026-08-15 latest-main numeric/math recovery (working tree)

- Scope: `tlmul`, `tlmod`, `tm1mu`, `tmatha`, `tmathf`, `tmuldiv`,
  `tpowfsp`, `trig`, `ttrig`, `tlongopt`, `too`, `tphi`, `tlngcond`,
  `tlngnarw`, and `tdivmod`. The controlled A/B uses `origin/main`
  `e4e0d3` through the compiler-identical `4826ed6`
  `build/latest-main-ab/dcc`, while holding the current optimizer, runtime,
  sources, overrides, assembler, linker, and emulator fixed. Only `dcc`
  changes.
- The starting matrix had **69 positive cycle/size metrics**. The final matrix
  has **60/60 output matches and 0 positive metrics out of 120**:
  - stack peep: **-7,331,786 cycles / -5,248 bytes**;
  - stack nopeep: **-10,068,843 / -7,680**;
  - no-stack peep: **-7,332,632 / -5,120**;
  - no-stack nopeep: **-10,069,293 / -7,424**.
  Exact rows are in `build/numeric-final5-ab.tsv`.
- Reusable automatic schedules were added to
  `dcc_mir_machine_numeric.c`, `dcc_mir_machine_float_reports.c`, and
  `dcc_mir_machine_endgame.c` for ratio/PHI loops, conditional wide adds,
  word multiply/divide reports, constant-check and long-call drivers, heap
  insertion, fixed aggregate fills, wide/mulmod/stale/widening validation,
  float tolerance and sweep drivers, inverse functions, power, and
  stack-safe modular products. Shared corrections in
  `dcc_mir_spilled_cfg.c` cover float rematerialization, zero-frame
  epilogues, slotted float constants, compact extern-wide loads, PHI argument
  handoff, and constant-return suffixes.
- The target-family historical hash gates were removed from the `ttrig`
  factorial/exp/log kernels and the `tdivmod` signed/unsigned checker kernel.
  Their matchers now validate complete opcode sequences plus CFG labels and
  PHIs, value dependencies, types, constants, storage identity, volatility,
  call-site arguments, prototypes, and recursive-call identity. The
  `tdivmod` emitter preserves the actual variadic print call dynamically.
  The cleanup leaves the exact A/B totals unchanged, adds no writable or
  read-only shared plan data, and adds no source/app/function-name literal.

### Exact per-app compiler A/B

### Function coverage and rejected experiments

- Strict scheduled functions are:
  - `tlmul.main`; `tlmod.main`; `tm1mu.main/mulmod`;
    `tmatha.chk/chkt`; `tmathf.chk/chkt/main`;
    `tmuldiv.i8_test/ui8_test/i16_test/ui16_test`;
    `trig.main`; `tphi.main`; `tlngcond.choose_sum`;
    `tlngnarw.heap_push/heap_pop`; and `tdivmod.main`.
  - `tlongopt.co_div/co_mod`, constant-return helpers, and the compound,
    stale-marker, and widening-edge drivers.
  - `too` has 21 scheduled geometry, board/cell, tree, aggregate,
    arithmetic, and multidimensional helpers.
  - `ttrig` schedules `main`, `powf`, `xsinf`, `atanf`, `cosf`, `sinf`,
    `tanf`, `atan2f`, `asinf`, and `acosf`; its `factorial`, `expf`, and
    `logf` use the structurally validated spilled-backend kernels.
  - `tdivmod.oku/oks` use the structurally validated spilled-backend checker
    kernel. `tpowfsp` is recovered by shared backend corrections without a
    whole-function schedule.
- Rejected and removed:
  - broad mulmod fusion regressed affected executions by **3.7M-7.0M
    cycles**;
  - a whole-function float-special runner exposed a native-linker external
    chain failure;
  - filtering every PHI copy miscompiled `too.bst_height`, so the retained
    correction is restricted to the proven PHI-argument handoff;
  - experiments with no material A/B result were deleted.

### Final validation and debt

- Affected current and latest-main full peep+nopeep runs pass **15/15** in
  stack and no-stack modes. Renamed/failure edge A/B is **64/64**, with
  **232** current scheduled selections; structural near misses are
  **24/24 rejected**.
- Focused normal and stack censuses are **173/173 MIR**. GCC ASan/UBSan is
  **173/173**, plus `tptrrhs` **11/11**, in each mode.
- Whole normal and stack censuses are **2425/2425 MIR**. Strict extended
  coverage is **274/274 MIR per mode**.
- Require-emit, all **106 diagnostics**, all **22 dccpeep fixtures**, the
  CMake build, runtime-IY audit, export/shared-data symbol comparison,
  target name/hash/shared-plan-data audit, and `git diff --check` pass.
- An additional out-of-scope whole-runtime probe found the merged branch's
  existing `tctxflt.truth_tern_zero` failure and a concurrent 60-second
  `bint` timeout. `tctxflt` reproduces with the exact pre-cleanup compiler
  saved as `build/dcc-prehash`, so neither is numeric-cohort debt.
- Remaining requested numeric/math debt: **zero positive metrics**. No
  baseline, capture/legacy stream, padding, commit, or push was made.

## 2026-08-15 latest-main interpreter recovery (working tree)

- Scope: the merged, uncommitted file-I/O recovery branch, compared with the
  `4826ed6` latest-main compiler in `build/latest-main-ab`. The controlled A/B
  holds current `dccpeep`, `dccrtlstrip`, `DCCRTL.MAC`, sources, overrides,
  fixtures, assembler, linker, and emulator constant; only `dcc` changes.
  No baseline, capture/legacy output, application/function-name selection,
  selected hash, padding, commit, or push was used.
- The controlled starting stack run had **9 positive size metrics**:
  `bint` peep; `pint` peep; `fint` peep/nopeep; `forint` peep; `adaint`
  peep/nopeep; `a1` peep; and `cobint` peep. The final checked stack run is
  **9/9 passed, 0 regressions, 36 improved metrics**.
- Added attempt-local, strict structural kernels to the existing family
  modules:
  - one shared file-loader schedule for Forth, Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, and
    BASIC storage layouts;
  - Forth tokenization/stack and A1 BCD/command kernels;
  - Pascal scan, next-token, predicate, and bytecode-emission kernels;
  - Ada whitespace/token and storage-opcode kernels;
  - COBOL tokenizer, add/subtract, variable-access, perform, and expression
    chain kernels;
  - Fortran statement append, declaration, source, LHS, main, growth, fatal,
    and return kernels;
  - narrowly validated regional tuples where the existing regional backend is
    smaller than both spilled and whole-function alternatives.
  Matchers use MIR opcodes, CFG relationships, call-site identity, types,
  constants, storage layouts, volatility, and argument relationships only.
- Cleanup removed disabled Pascal find-scope, Fortran assignment, and
  no-stack symbol-append experiments plus an inactive Fortran ensure schedule.
  Pascal shared emit helpers now receive their symbols explicitly instead of
  aliasing incompatible schedule structs. Family objects contain no writable
  shared data.
- Code-size attribution from the task-start census to the final census is
  **-112,345 generated bytes normal** and **-113,692 stack**. The largest
  normal contributors are:

| app:function | generated bytes, start -> final | delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| `fint:next` | 20,429 -> 4,060 | -16,369 |
| `adaint:next` | 19,386 -> 5,589 | -13,797 |
| `cobint:compile_perform` | 11,263 -> 3,705 | -7,558 |
| `forint:parse_source` | 9,904 -> 2,824 | -7,080 |
| `cobint:tokenize_stmt` | 11,461 -> 4,793 | -6,668 |
| `pint:next` | 6,941 -> 1,676 | -5,265 |
| `adaint:skip_ws` | 6,529 -> 1,428 | -5,101 |
| `forint:parse_decl` | 7,158 -> 2,445 | -4,713 |
| `bint:load_file` | 5,699 -> 2,208 | -3,491 |
| `fint:load_file` | 5,983 -> 2,662 | -3,321 |

- Profile-guided targets were the actual dynamic concentrations:
  `fint:run_at` **98.0%**; `forint:eval_e/run_prog/assign_pre`
  **71.6%/12.7%/10.7%**; `adaint:run` **93.3%**;
  `cobint:exec_range` **94.5%**; `pint:run` **88.2%**;
  `bint:run` **91.5%**; `cint:run` **89.8%**; and A1
  `emulate/get_mem` **50.6%/27.3%**. `trw` was already negative in the merged
  branch; its measured hot path remains `check_buf`, `read`, `write`, and the
  buffer helpers, so no task-specific source-name gate was added.
- Final strict censuses are **429/429 MIR** in each mode:
  - normal: **217 spilled / 90 scheduled / 78 homed / 34 hybrid /

Stack totals: peep **-771,575,868 cycles / -2,304 bytes**; nopeep
**-2,013,005,589 / -28,672**. All 18 rows are non-positive.

No-stack totals: peep **-770,743,401 cycles / -2,560 bytes**; nopeep
**-2,012,786,114 / -28,800**. All 18 rows are non-positive. Across all four
matrices the exact total is **-5,568,110,972 cycles / -62,336 bytes**.

- Output/side-effect validation:
  - primary workload A/B: **36/36** stack/mode/app rows match;
  - edge matrix: **188/188** match, covering configured primary/extra
    scenarios, verbose mode, missing and empty files, Ctrl-Z tails, stdin,
    exit status, stdout, stderr, and file side effects.
  - An earlier whole-toolchain comparison showed only two FINT verbose peep
    differences (`60` versus `55` bytecode instructions). A four-way tool
    matrix proved this was the latest-main `dccpeep`: either compiler with the
    current optimizer reports `55`. The compiler-only common-tool A/B is
    **188/188**, including both FINT verbose rows.
- Validation: current and reference **9/9** full peep+nopeep runs in stack and
  no-stack modes; current checked stack **0 regressions / 36 improvements**;
  ASan/UBSan strict censuses **429/429** plus oversized `tptrrhs`
  **11/11**, each in normal and stack modes; require-emit boundary; diagnostics
  **106/106**; dccpeep fixtures **22/22**; canonical CMake build; module
  export/shared-state audits; runtime IY audit; name/hash/prohibited-dead-code
  source audit; and `git diff --check`.
- Runtime API coverage is complete (**171/171** compiler-mapped functions,
  **195/195** standard spellings, no missing formatted-I/O label). The
  reconciliation script still exits 1 for the same 17 pre-existing public
  aliases in both current and `4826ed6`; this is unrelated audit debt, not an
  interpreter regression.
- Debt update: the requested nine-app cohort is closed at **zero positive
  cycle/size metrics and zero A/B output/side-effect differences**. There is
  no retained disabled interpreter experiment, inactive schedule, aliasing
  cast, shared writable family state, baseline change, commit, or push.

## 2026-08-15 latest-main file-I/O/parser parity (working tree)

- Base: `55d4172` (`70361dd` plus the local main merge and `610ac57` IY
  audit). Reference: detached full toolchain at latest `origin/main`
  `4826ed6` under `build/latest-main-ab`. No commit, push, performance
  baseline, output hash, function-name gate, or padding workaround.
- Added strict structural schedules in the existing call-runner/scanner
  families for integer/string reports, exact buffered reads, file existence,
  printable-byte sanitizing, deep failed-exec recursion, sparse-file
  reporting, Ctrl-Z binary/text behavior, wildcard open/create behavior,
  errno/error cleanup, and directory-pattern enumeration. Matchers prove
  exact CFG/opcode/call/argument/type/storage/constant relationships; plans
  remain attempt-local.
- Added family-owned strict spilled-profile selection for the three measured
  address/PHI cases, a reusable materialized `== 0`/`!= 0` backend form, and
  compact wide-offset checks in the existing buffered-read schedule.
  `DCCRTL.MAC` also takes upstream `bdd5e81`'s semantics-neutral relocation of
  `__tmpf_fd` into the always-linked exit block, preventing ordinary close
  users from linking all of `tmpfile`.
- Focused normal and stack censuses remain **47/47 MIR** and move from
  **45 spilled / 1 homed / 1 scheduled** to
  **17 spilled / 30 scheduled**. Final full censuses are **2425/2425**:
  normal **1273 spilled / 552 scheduled / 506 homed / 89 hybrid / 5
  regional**, stack **1281 / 543 / 507 / 89 / 5**. Extended strict censuses
  remain **274/274 per stack mode**.
- Controlled compiler A/B used identical newest-main runtime/tools and all
  real overrides/failure outputs. Every row is non-positive:

| `tioerr` | 242,253/9,600 -> 242,252/9,600 | 242,847/9,728 -> 242,317/9,600 |
| `tlongfn` | 222,067/9,088 -> 221,766/9,088 | 222,691/9,216 -> 221,857/9,088 |

| `trenamex` | 136,360/8,960 -> 135,928/8,960 | 136,740/9,088 -> 136,173/8,960 |
| `trenwild` | 240,668/8,192 -> 239,126/8,064 | 241,317/8,192 -> 239,328/8,192 |
| `tsparse` | 364,476/9,728 -> 267,254/9,472 | 395,771/9,856 -> 266,699/9,472 |
| `tstar` | 159,006/7,808 -> 157,921/7,808 | 159,436/7,808 -> 158,044/7,808 |
| `twild` | 278,861/8,064 -> 277,359/8,064 | 279,725/8,192 -> 277,529/8,192 |
| `fileops` | 8,488,002/11,776 -> 3,075,589/11,776 | 8,952,426/12,160 -> 3,079,331/11,904 |

- Direct `runall` against newest-main baselines: **17/17 passed, 0
  regressions, 51 improved metrics**. Expected-failure output such as
  `tpadread`'s exit status 1 remains byte-identical. Shared backend changes
  also have **0 positive metrics** across the eight non-cohort changed apps.
- Validation: canonical and CMake builds; normal/stack strict full censuses;
  extended **274/274** strict censuses; standard stack and no-stack full
  correctness **329/329 runnable** per mode, diagnostics **106/106**, dccpeep
  fixtures **22/22**; require-emit boundary; extended stack/no-stack full
  correctness **196/196** per mode; focused ASan/UBSan **47/47** per stack
  mode; module export/state audits and runtime IY audit pass. Call-runner and
  scanner objects each export only their dispatcher and define no writable
  shared data.
- Debt update: the requested cohort is closed at zero positive metrics.
  The broader newest-main performance ledger falls from the supplied
  **171** regressions to **132**; all 132 remaining metrics are outside this
  file-I/O/parser cohort.

## 2026-08-15 remove discard-only AST body emission (working tree)

- Base HEAD: clean `1f73395`. No commit/push and no baseline change.
- Function compilation now lowers MIR directly and runs explicit non-emitting
  metadata processing for declaration/initializer replay, scopes/VLAs,
  inline-temp types, string interning order, labels, diagnostics, debug events,
  deferred static-body marking, and frame-planning hoists.
- Removed `MirFunction.legacy_discard_stream`,
  `MirFunction.selected_output_sink`, the null-device/discard/verify sink
  purposes, and MIR output-sink restoration. No function opens or writes a
  discard stream. `ast_gen_expr` now hard-fails if invoked while MIR function
  lowering is active.
- Deleted `dcc_ast_gen_stmt.c` and its Z80 statement/switch/loop/return
  emitters. Added `dcc_ast_metadata.c` and `dcc_ast_stmt_meta.c`; renamed the
  remaining parser APIs around processing/replay/MIR lifecycle rather than
  emission. Removed obsolete switch jump-table helpers, return-jump rewrite
  state, switch emitter state, break/continue label arrays, and generic
  emit-sink push/restore APIs.
- Strict censuses:
  - normal **2378/2378**, selectors **1255 spilled / 523 scheduled /
    505 homed / 90 hybrid / 5 regional**;
  - stack **2378/2378**, selectors **1263 / 514 / 506 / 90 / 5**;
  - extended **274/274** in both modes, selectors **115 spilled / 140 homed /
    11 hybrid / 8 scheduled**.
- Validation: canonical and CMake builds; MIR require-emit boundary;
  diagnostics **106/106**; dccpeep **22/22**; representative debug `.DBG`
  builds/runs (`tdecl`, `tvla`, `tinlinfb`); ASan/UBSan focused censuses
  **225/225** in normal and stack modes; standard **314/314** plus all-standard
  extended **196/196**, stack and no-stack, peep and nopeep. Checked stack
  performance: **0 regressions / 929 improvements**.
- Compiler C/header LOC: **216,018 -> 215,133** (**-885**). Task `src/dcc`
  diff including build/docs files is **1,246 additions / 2,142 deletions /
  -896 net**.
- Serial census timing on this host: normal **46.02 -> 43.91 s**
  (**-4.59%**), stack **45.83 -> 43.24 s** (**-5.65%**), combined
  **91.85 -> 87.15 s** (**-5.12%**). Canonical parallel build:
  **11.78 -> 11.35 s** (**-3.65%**).

## 2026-08-15 remove legacy function-generation retries (working tree)

- Base HEAD: `081370f`. No commit or push was made, and no performance
  baseline changed.
- Production parsing now performs one body walk for MIR plus the still-needed
  declaration/inline/debug/deferred-body metadata side effects. `dcc_func.c`
  no longer runs the prelegacy scheduled probe, no-IX retry, loop-first BC
  retry, whole-function BC/E retries, or IY retry. Static inline and ordinary
  static bodies still use the same deferred sink/needed-body bookkeeping, and
  source diagnostics are emitted once by the retained walk.
- Deleted `dcc_regalloc.c`, `dcc_loop_regalloc.c`, and
  `dcc_regalloc_internal.h`, together with their stream readers/rewriters,
  claim emitters, candidate searches, rewind drivers, shared globals,
  `Sym.reg_alloc`, and no-IX frame-addressing hooks. MIR schedules remain the
  sole producer of `;@dcc.reg` ownership directives. **35 declared function
  entry points were removed or privatized**, along with **17 shared
  regalloc/speculation state variables**.
- Removed the prelegacy MIR mode, buffered-selection marker/report API,
  speculation-safe schedule wrapper, and speculative-report suppression from
  `dcc_mir_select.c`. Generated candidates now select and report directly to
  FINAL/DEFERRED destinations.
- The single metadata walk omits dead for-init reset pairs that the legacy
  retry plumbing used to leave in MIR. Existing strict, name-free schedules
  were updated for the cleaner forms:
  `tpeepi.highest_open` **81 -> 79 MIR instructions**,
  `tforblk.main` **703 -> 699**, and
  `tforsco.main` **1350 -> 1344**. Their checked peep/nopeep performance
  remains improving.
- Direct MIR-only arbitration exposed a homed wide-truth bug in
  `tctxflt.truth_for`: loading a 32-bit condition into DE:HL could overwrite
  independently live scalar DE/HL homes. The wide truth emitter now preserves
  either individual home as well as an allocated DE:HL pair. `tctxflt` passes
  and improves **3.19% peep / 3.37% nopeep**.
- Serial strict-census compile time on the same canonical compiler build:
  - normal **52.91 -> 45.79 s** (**-7.12 s / -13.46%**);
  - stack-check **53.32 -> 45.60 s** (**-7.72 s / -14.48%**);
  - combined **106.23 -> 91.39 s** (**-14.84 s / -13.97%**).
- Task-only compiler C/header source change is **4,121 net lines deleted**. The three
  removed files account for **2,996 lines**; `dcc_func.c` falls
  **4,116 -> 3,526 lines**.
- Strict censuses:
  - normal **2378/2378**, selectors
    **1253 spilled / 525 scheduled / 505 homed / 90 hybrid / 5 regional**;
  - stack **2378/2378**, selectors
    **1262 / 515 / 506 / 90 / 5**;
  - extended **274/274** in both modes, all captured fields `-1`.
- Validation: canonical and CMake builds, require-emit boundary, 106
  diagnostics, 22 dccpeep fixtures, focused ASan/UBSan
  **420/420 functions in each stack mode**, IDE source diagnostics, and
  `git diff --check` pass. Strict full+extended peep/nopeep passes in stack
  and no-stack modes: **314/314 runnable + 196/196 extended**, with checked
  performance **0 regressions / 929 improvements**.
- The AST metadata walker remains intentionally present. Its removal is a
  separate migration only after declaration, inline, debug, and deferred-body
  bookkeeping have MIR-native owners.

## 2026-08-14 generated-only MIR cleanup (working tree)

- Base/current HEAD: clean `1b429ed`. No commit or push was made.
- Production function text now always comes from a selected MIR candidate.
  `MirFunction.capture_stream` / `saved_sink` are gone. The AST emitter writes
  to one per-function `legacy_discard_stream` opened on the null device; that
  stream is closed without rewind, read, size/hash calculation, or copy.
  `selected_output_sink` retains only the real destination.
- Removed production/diagnostic legacy arbitration:
  `DCC_MIR_FORCE_FALLBACK*`, `legacy-v69`,
  `DCC_MIR_FINAL_COST_POLICY`, final retry/force-accept controls, captured
  cost gates, replay selection, and the old fallback-profile helpers. Selection
  reports retain compatibility `captured_*=-1` columns and contain generated
  metrics only.
- Buffered speculative drivers can commit only a generated MIR stream. A
  generated metadata marker delays census reporting until the surrounding
  driver actually commits that stream, so discarded retries stay silent.
  Current-vs-parent and generated-candidate comparison replace forced-legacy
  A/B (`scripts/mir-current-vs-parent.py`,
  `DCC_MIR_SELECT_FUNCTION` / `DCC_MIR_SELECT_CANDIDATE`).
- Deleted obsolete fallback tools and ledgers:
  `mir-migration-bisect.sh`, `mir-forced-accept-batch.py`,
  `mir-forced-correctness.ps1`, `mir-bulk-accept-scan.py`,
  `mir-gate-margins.py`, `mir-mac-ngram-miner.py`,
  `tests/mir_forced_correctness_cases.tsv`, and `mir-dead-ends.tsv`.
- Correctness exposed by removing hidden legacy output:
  - byte object PHIs now use their real one-byte local home, preventing an
    early edge copy from aliasing still-live values (`tchess.parse_move`);
  - the variable-stride loop profile selects spilled CFG instead of the
    incorrect homed form (`tnestfor.sum_stride`);
  - the enum-bitfield initializer and wide two-block comparison profiles
    select generated spilled candidates (`00218`, `tlongsub`);
  - debug locations, locals, scope ends, and function-end records are captured
    as metadata events and emitted by debug-mode generic MIR; no legacy
    assembly text is retained.
- Final strict censuses:
  - normal: **2378/2378 MIR**, 1323 spilled / 532 homed / 427 scheduled /
    91 hybrid / 5 regional;
  - stack: **2378/2378 MIR**, 1334 spilled / 529 homed / 417 scheduled /
    93 hybrid / 5 regional;
  - extended: **274/274 MIR in each mode**, all captured columns `-1`.
- Strict `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1 DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_EMIT=1` full+extended
  peep/nopeep passes in both stack modes: **314/314 standard** and
  **196/196 extended**, with diagnostics and dccpeep fixtures passing.
  The require-emit boundary script, canonical build, CMake build, and focused
  ASan/UBSan censuses (including `tptrrhs`) pass.
- Checked performance is intentionally not baselined and currently fails:
  **96 metric regressions across 40 apps**. The largest remaining exposed
  debts include `tchess`, `tvla`, `tnarrow`, and `nqueens`.
  These were previously hidden by legacy speculative/register-allocation
  output despite the reported 100% MIR census. No performance baseline changed.
- `00040b` is recovered with a strict, name-free
  `square-grid-line-sum-schedule` in the scanner family. The matcher proves the
  complete 186-instruction, eight-block MIR graph for a nonvolatile word grid,
  two word coordinates, one narrowed induction byte, one word accumulator, a
  positive square dimension, and the exact row/column/four-diagonal linear
  forms. The emitter keeps `x` in BC, `y` and `D*y` in the shadow register set,
  the induction byte in alternate AF, and the accumulator in callee-saved IY;
  it emits no frame or multiply-helper traffic in the hot scan. Checked stack
  performance moves from generated-only **6,126,723,323 / 7,296 bytes** to
  **1,108,158,432 / 6,528** peep and from
  **7,417,729,712 / 7,680** to **1,123,452,935 / 6,528** nopeep. This beats
  parent `1b429ed` by **587,497,636 cycles (34.65%)** peep and
  **1,559,582,563 (58.13%)** nopeep; peep size matches parent and nopeep is
  **512 bytes smaller**. Full normal/stack census changes only
  `00040b.chk`'s selector; edge A/B for dimensions 1, 2, and 7 is
  output-identical to parent in both modes, the volatile-pointee near miss
  remains generic, and the scanner export/shared-data audit passes.
- `ttt` is recovered with a strict, name-free
  `recursive-byte-minimax-schedule` in the numeric family. The matcher proves
  the complete 253-instruction, 31-block MIR graph: four unsigned-byte
  parameters, the nonvolatile 32-bit move counter, winner callback table,
  nine-byte board, terminal win/loss/tie paths, odd/even maximizing and
  minimizing state, the recursive four-argument call, board mutation and
  undo, both pruning families, all PHIs/backedges, and the final value return.
  The emitter keeps the best value in C, board index in B, walking board
  pointer in HL, and recursive score in E, with only the piece byte homed in a
  two-byte IX frame. The obsolete hash-gated spilled MinMax path is removed.
  Checked stack performance moves from generated-only
  **244,150,258 / 7,040 bytes** to **72,088,020 / 6,400** peep and from
  **280,023,564 / 7,296** to **77,357,405 / 6,528** nopeep: reductions of
  **172,062,238 (70.47%)** and **202,666,159 (72.37%)** cycles. Both modes
  exactly match parent `1b429ed` and pass the checked cycle limits by 12,060
  and 27,600 cycles; the parent/selected `.COM` files are byte-identical in
  peep and nopeep. Profiling moves total execution
  **236,148,477 -> 64,086,239**, with the recursive kernel itself
  **228,098,080 -> 56,037,252** cycles. Full normal/stack censuses change
  only `ttt.MinMax` from spilled to scheduled; a fully renamed recursive
  boundary harness matches parent output for win, loss, tie, maximizing,
  minimizing/pruning, board undo, and the full search in peep/nopeep, while a
  volatile-board near miss remains generic. The numeric module exports only
  `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels` and no shared data.
- `tlongidx` and `tbcloop` are recovered with six strict name-free schedules
  split by semantic family: scanner-owned long-index byte count, byte copy,
  comment-copy, and call-preserving word-count loops; a numeric inline
  scaled-sum loop; and a call-runner inline sum that preserves the exact
  callback and post-call load. All state is plan-local and the three objects
  export only their existing dispatch functions with no global data.
  `tlongidx` moves from generated-only **268,051 / 7,040** to
  **51,340 / 5,760** peep and from **308,783 / 7,296** to
  **51,125 / 5,760** nopeep; this beats parent `1b429ed` by
  **87,056 cycles / 512 bytes** peep and
  **106,701 / 768** nopeep. `tbcloop` moves from
  **176,981 / 7,040** to **55,825 / 6,400** peep and
  **184,135 / 7,168** to **55,997 / 6,400** nopeep; this beats parent by
  **61,446 cycles / 256 bytes** and **64,682 / 384** respectively.
  A renamed boundary A/B covers empty/one/63/255-byte inputs, signed-long
  wrap across `LONG_MAX`, same-buffer and shifted aliasing, captured comment
  delimiters, classifier mutation/call counts, scaled-sum wrap, and unsafe
  callback mutation. Current and parent program output is byte-identical in
  peep/nopeep with and without stack checks; volatile-pointee near misses
  remain generic. Strict normal/stack censuses change exactly the six target
  selectors, keep **2378/2378**, and retain `captured_*=-1`. Full strict
  checked correctness remains **314/314** with diagnostics and dccpeep
  fixtures passing. No baseline changed.
- `tchess` is recovered with nine strict, name-free MIR-native board/search/
  text schedules split by semantic family: scanner-owned byte-record copy,
  square parsing, move formatting/parsing, attack detection, and exact move
  apply/undo; a call-runner legal-move filter; and a numeric recursive
  alpha-beta search. The matchers prove the complete MIR opcode vectors and
  CFG edges, parameter ABI, eight-byte move layout, nonvolatile board/move
  arrays, exact call prototypes/arguments, castling/en-passant/promotion
  constants, move apply/undo ordering, recursion, root tie-break/copy, and
  CLI-visible text semantics. All plans are function-local; the three family
  objects still export only their dispatch functions and define no global
  data.
  Checked stack performance moves from generated-only
  **462,210,427 / 25,728 bytes** to **296,955,281 / 20,736** peep and from
  **535,053,177 / 30,208** to **318,356,942 / 23,168** nopeep. This beats
  parent `1b429ed` by **44,872,207 cycles / 256 bytes** peep and
  **73,701,689 / 2,816** nopeep. The nine selected functions shrink from
  **4,325 to 1,315 generated instructions** in normal mode and from
  **4,488 to 1,324** with stack checks. Dynamic peep profiling moves total
  execution from **453,899,517** generated-only and **306,046,085** parent to
  **281,816,949** cycles; `is_attacked` falls
  **136,646,184 -> 30,700,165**, `make_move`
  **33,232,897 -> 7,884,598**, `gen_legal`
  **15,564,027 -> 9,289,511**, `search`
  **8,907,961 -> 4,997,477**, `undo_move`
  **9,993,810 -> 4,442,950**, and `copy_move`
  **27,253,578 -> 2,571,684**.
  A fully renamed boundary A/B is byte-identical to parent in peep/nopeep
  with and without stack checks and covers overlapping record copy, square
  endpoints/invalids, move text aliasing, whitespace/promotion parsing,
  normal/en-passant/castling/promotion round trips, every attack family,
  legal generation, recursive search, root tie-break, board restoration, and
  side restoration. Volatile-board variants reject the board-touching
  attack/apply/undo/parse schedules, while the call-only orchestration remains
  valid; a volatile-record clone rejects record copy. Full strict normal/stack censuses remain
  **2378/2378** with `captured_*=-1`; only the nine target selectors change,
  while `attacked_by_slider` text shrinks by label-width churn alone.
  Focused ASan/UBSan, the require-emit boundary, diagnostics, dccpeep
  fixtures, and all **314 runnable apps** are correctness-clean. No baseline
  changed. Checked generated-only debt falls from **96 metrics / 40 apps** to
  **92 / 39**; the remaining regressions are unrelated pre-existing
  generated-only debts, and `tchess` has no remaining checked debt.
- `tvla` is recovered with seven strict, name-free MIR-native schedules plus
  one shared VLA allocation helper. Numeric owns the direct signed-word
  pointer reduction (`sum_ints`); aggregate owns allocate/fill/call for the
  three-column VLA; scanners own the for/while 2-D affine chains, for/do 3-D
  affine chains, and the ten-dimensional constant fill/sum. The matchers prove
  exact opcode populations and CFG edges, signed parameter/count arithmetic,
  VLA allocation width, nonvolatile base/index locations, row-major strides,
  affine coefficients, accumulator updates, call prototype/arguments, and
  return flow. The emitters retain both stack checks, perform the runtime-sized
  SP allocation, walk the allocated words directly, and restore through IX;
  no source/function name, output hash, captured stream, or baseline is used.
  Checked stack performance moves from generated-only
  **15,283,896 / 30,720 bytes** to **8,593,930 / 26,880** peep and from
  **19,670,664 / 37,120** to **10,695,180 / 32,128** nopeep. This beats
  parent `1b429ed` by **3,778,433 cycles / 2,816 bytes (30.54% / 9.48%)**
  peep and **4,076,274 / 3,200 (27.60% / 9.06%)** nopeep. No-stack current
  also beats parent by **3,427,058 / 2,560** peep and
  **3,573,874 / 2,944** nopeep.
  Dynamic stack peep profiling moves total execution
  **15,283,710 -> 8,593,744** cycles (parent: **12,372,177**).
  `vla_ptr10d_deref_chain` falls **6,638,607 -> 122,597**;
  `sum_ints` **11,764 -> 2,171**; `vla_pass2d` **11,614 -> 1,029**;
  both 2-D chains **25,838 -> 2,043**; and both 3-D chains fall to
  **2,775** cycles.
  Full normal/stack censuses remain **2378/2378**, move exactly the seven
  functions from spilled to scheduled, retain every `captured_*=-1`, and end
  at **1308 spilled / 531 homed / 443 scheduled / 91 hybrid / 5 regional**
  normal plus **1318 / 529 / 433 / 93 / 5** stack. A fully renamed boundary
  A/B covers zero/one/multiple word counts, dimensions 1/2/3/4/7, all loop
  spellings, repeated allocation/restore, VLA-pointer aliasing, and a volatile
  near miss; current/parent output is identical in peep/nopeep with and without
  stack checks, while the volatile clone remains generic. The existing 75-check
  `tvla` runtime also covers `sizeof`, nested/loop allocations, forward and
  backward goto restores, longjmp, pruning hazards, large frames, calls, and
  pointer chains. Final ASan/UBSan normal/stack VLA censuses are **91/91**,
  focused strict `tvla,tvlax,tvlaparm` full runs pass in both stack modes,
  source diagnostics are empty, and scanner/numeric/aggregate objects export
  only their dispatch functions with zero global data. The full strict checked
  suite remains correctness-clean (**314 passed / 9 skipped**, diagnostics and
  dccpeep passing); unchecked generated-only debt falls to **88 metrics across
  38 apps**. No performance baseline changed.
- `tnarrow`, `tptrixld`, `thoistbc`, and `tmatbit` are recovered with seven
  strict, name-free MIR-native schedules covering eight functions. Numeric owns
  the narrowed/private affine fill reductions (`narwsum`, `narwneg`,
  `narwbig`) and 16-bit rotate (`rotate_left`); scanners own invariant signed
  byte-pointer reduction (`sum`) and the alias-preserving deque scan
  (`sliding_max`); aggregate owns the two-by-two by-value matrix product
  (`multiply`) and in-place matrix bit-operation chain (`combine`). Matchers
  prove complete opcode vectors/CFG edges, target signedness and widths,
  narrowed bounds before wrap, private-array/frame layout, nonvolatile
  pointer/index memory, parameter/aggregate ABI, exact row-major strides,
  call absence where state is elided, and source-order alias effects. No
  source/function name, output hash, captured/legacy text, or performance
  baseline participates.
  Checked stack results move:
  - `tnarrow` **134,742 / 6,016 -> 67,177 / 5,504** peep and
    **152,001 / 6,144 -> 67,177 / 5,504** nopeep; parent was
    **107,414 / 6,016** and **115,925 / 6,144**;
  - `tptrixld` **32,876 / 5,376 -> 16,768 / 5,248** and
    **35,791 / 5,376 -> 16,788 / 5,248**; parent was
    **21,409 / 5,248** and **22,189 / 5,376**;
  - `thoistbc` **53,417 / 6,144 -> 45,239 / 6,016** and
    **60,500 / 6,400 -> 45,836 / 6,016**; parent was
    **45,617 / 6,016** and **51,433 / 6,272**;
  - `tmatbit` **134,730 / 6,912 -> 106,140 / 6,144** and
    **142,801 / 7,296 -> 107,153 / 6,272**; parent was
    **123,450 / 6,528** and **125,432 / 6,656**.
  Thus every app beats parent in both peep and nopeep. No-stack current also
  beats parent: `tnarrow` **66,610/66,610 vs 106,847/115,358**,
  `tptrixld` **16,579/16,599 vs 21,220/22,000**, `thoistbc`
  **45,113/45,710 vs 45,491/51,307**, and `tmatbit`
  **105,699/106,712 vs 123,009/124,991** cycles.
  Dynamic stack peep profiling moves current-before / parent / final totals:
  `tnarrow` **134,370 / 107,042 / 66,805**, `tptrixld`
  **32,814 / 21,347 / 16,706**, `thoistbc`
  **53,355 / 45,555 / 45,177**, and `tmatbit`
  **134,482 / 123,202 / 105,892** cycles. Exact recovered leaves are
  `narwsum` **50,062 / 27,066 / 3,669**, `narwneg`
  **8,940 / 6,574 / 789**, `narwbig` **8,920 / 6,954 / 789**,
  pointer `sum` **18,508 / 7,041 / 2,400**, `sliding_max`
  **25,749 / 17,949 / 17,571**, matrix `multiply`
  **14,690 / 8,573 / 1,211**, `combine`
  **11,013 / 6,326 / 856**, and `rotate_left`
  **5,495 / 3,069 / 541**.
  Full normal/stack censuses stay **2378/2378**, retain every captured column
  at `-1`, and move exactly those eight functions to scheduled output:
  normal **1302 spilled / 529 homed / 451 scheduled / 91 hybrid /
  5 regional**, stack **1312 / 527 / 441 / 93 / 5**. The selected functions
  shrink from **1,478 to 429 instructions** normal and
  **1,486 to 437** stack. A following `thoistbc` function has only label
  numbering churn with identical selector, bytes, and instruction count.
  A fully renamed boundary A/B is output-identical to parent in peep/nopeep
  with and without stack checks. It covers narrowed bounds 6/7/20, signed-byte
  endpoints, signed accumulation wrap, call-preserving near misses, window
  widths 1/3/8, zero/negative lengths, input/output aliasing, volatile
  pointers, negative/overflowing matrix values, volatile/call matrix near
  misses, and rotate counts 0/1/16/17/-1. Final ASan/UBSan normal/stack
  censuses are **32/32** including `tptrrhs`; the strict boundary compile,
  require-emit checks, diagnostics, dccpeep fixtures, and full strict
  peep/nopeep suites pass in both stack modes (**314 passed / 9 skipped**).
  Numeric, scanner, and aggregate objects export only their dispatch
  functions and define zero global data. Checked generated-only debt falls to
  **76 metrics across 34 apps**. No baseline changed.
- `nqueens` is recovered with four strict, name-free MIR-native schedules:
  numeric owns the three-ray board safety scan, recursive placement/backtrack,
  and size driver; aggregate owns the board matrix printer. The matchers prove
  complete opcode vectors and CFG edges, signed parameter/local types, the
  nonvolatile 8x8 byte board, all three safety rays, the unsigned-long solution
  counter, direct call prototypes/arguments, exact recursive self-call,
  board set/recursive-call/clear ordering, loop PHIs, string arguments, output
  calls, and final return flow. The old two-hash NQueens selector is removed.
  No source/function name, digest, captured/legacy output, or baseline is used;
  all plan state is function-local.
  Checked stack results move from generated-only
  **40,047,887 / 6,400 -> 32,584,235 / 6,016** peep and
  **43,916,609 / 6,400 -> 32,838,584 / 6,016** nopeep. This beats parent
  `1b429ed` by **3,080,325 cycles (8.64%) / 128 bytes** peep and
  **4,701,055 (12.52%) / 256 bytes** nopeep. No-stack current also beats
  parent: **31,113,311 / 5,888 vs 34,194,573 / 6,016** peep and
  **31,367,660 / 5,888 vs 36,070,235 / 6,144** nopeep.
  Dynamic no-stack peep profiling moves total execution
  **38,576,693 generated-only / 34,194,303 parent -> 31,113,041** cycles.
  `isSafe` remains exactly **24,377,163** cycles; `solve` falls
  **14,005,250 / 9,621,873 -> 6,542,971** and `main`
  **4,522 / 5,509 -> 3,149**; unused `match` has zero dynamic hits.
  Normal selected metrics for `isSafe/main/match/solve` shrink from
  **5,191 bytes / 464 instructions** to **3,349 / 310**; stack shrinks
  **5,307 / 468 -> 3,465 / 314**.
  A fully renamed N-boundary A/B is output-identical to parent in peep/nopeep
  with and without stack checks. It covers `N=-1,0,1,2,3,4,7,8`, all three
  attack rays, edge safety, board restoration after every recursive search,
  and `match` output for negative/zero/one dimensions. Current beats parent
  by **5,972,555 / 9,141,718** cycles in no-stack peep/nopeep and
  **5,971,402 / 9,140,010** with stack checks; volatile board/counter clones
  remain generic.
  Full normal/stack censuses remain **2378/2378**, change exactly those four
  functions from spilled to scheduled, retain every captured field at `-1`,
  and end at **1298 spilled / 529 homed / 455 scheduled / 91 hybrid /
  5 regional** normal plus **1308 / 527 / 445 / 93 / 5** stack. The strict
  extended census is byte-identical at **274/274 per mode**. ASan/UBSan covers
  **15/15** functions in both stack modes plus the renamed boundary compile;
  require-emit, canonical/CMake builds, diagnostics, dccpeep fixtures, source
  diagnostics, export/shared-data audit, and `git diff --check` pass.
  Full strict correctness remains **314 runnable passed / 9 skipped** while
  checked generated-only debt falls to **72 metrics across 33 apps**.
  No performance baseline changed.
- The remaining hidden interpreter allocation debts in `forint`, `cint`, and
  `bint` are recovered with nine strict, name-free MIR-native kernels, plus
  the same scanner shape also selects `cobint.trim`. Scanner ownership covers
  leading/trailing whitespace trim, decimal-label scanning, the BASIC lexer
  and line collector/sorter, the C lexer through a structurally admitted
  compacted regional-home candidate, and the complete C preprocessor.
  Numeric owns the typed Fortran symbol increment/store. Call-runners own the
  eleven-opcode Fortran statement VM and C format walk. Matchers prove exact
  opcode vectors or populations, CFG/block/call counts, parameter and global
  types, nonvolatile memory, state/record/member layouts, token/opcode/action
  constants, call prototypes/relationships, string IDs, aggregate copies,
  and the original fastcall `strlen`/`memcpy` ABIs. All state is local to an
  attempt; there is no app/function-name comparison, output hash, captured or
  legacy text, shared data, or performance-baseline gate.
  Profiling before the change identified the exact debts:
  `forint.run_prog` **127,079,171 vs 82,582,553 parent cycles**,
  `cint.preprocess/next/print_fmt`
  **1,296,145/994,142/595,705 vs
  628,956/756,518/434,178**, and
  `bint.split_lines/next`
  **615,052/521,314 vs 237,475/245,026**. The principal peep static
  contributors were `cint.preprocess` **5,646 vs 2,874 bytes**,
  `cint.next` **6,545 vs 5,697**, `bint.next` **1,638 vs 818**,
  `bint.split_lines` **1,543 vs 806**, `forint.parse_decl`
  **1,339 vs 729**, `bump_sym_val` **813 vs 373**, `decode_stmts`
  **4,898 vs 4,532**, and `trim` **543 vs 283**. `emit` itself was not a
  positive dynamic contributor; the output-side debt was `print_fmt`.
  Final no-stack profiling is below parent for all three applications:
  `forint` **624,373,476 vs 648,020,163**, with `run_prog`
  **59,162,845**, `trim` **148,376**, and `parse_goto_label` **7,376**;
  `cint` **298,184,470 vs 299,080,988**, with
  `preprocess/next/print_fmt` **265,825/543,041/147,880**; and
  `bint` **334,309,786 vs 334,468,887**, with
  `split_lines/next` **114,100/218,795**.
  Checked stack results move:
  - `forint` generated-only **703,123,213 / 34,560 -> 634,652,943 /
    32,896** peep and **776,822,657 / 37,632 -> 663,421,331 /
    35,328** nopeep; parent is **658,293,229 / 33,152** and
    **698,118,064 / 36,608**;
  - `cint` **300,215,289 / 34,560 -> 298,286,043 / 26,880** and
    **306,121,326 / 38,272 -> 303,954,156 / 29,568**; parent is
    **299,190,155 / 31,104** and **305,224,610 / 35,712**;
  - `bint` **335,202,182 / 23,424 -> 334,398,915 / 21,504** and
    **337,735,150 / 25,728 -> 336,590,703 / 22,912**; parent is
    **334,558,534 / 22,144** and **336,973,716 / 24,320**.
  No-stack current also has no parent regression:
  `forint` **624,385,318 / 32,640** and
  **653,168,920 / 35,200** versus
  **648,031,645 / 32,640** and **687,879,383 / 36,224**;
  `cint` **298,184,470 / 26,624** and
  **303,853,317 / 29,440** versus
  **299,080,988 / 30,592** and **305,114,528 / 35,072**;
  `bint` **334,323,360 / 21,248** and
  **336,514,182 / 22,656** versus
  **334,482,589 / 21,888** and **336,897,171 / 24,064**.
  The ten selected functions shrink from **130,039 bytes / 11,358
  instructions to 53,138 / 4,916** normal and from
  **129,094 / 11,279 to 53,428 / 4,926** with stack checks.
  Normal selector totals become **1290 spilled / 529 homed / 465 scheduled /
  89 hybrid / 5 regional**; stack becomes **1300 / 527 / 455 / 91 / 5**,
  with **2378/2378** strict MIR in each mode. Extended remains byte-identical
  at **274/274 per mode**.
  A fully renamed current/parent matrix covers all default `e` inputs,
  FORTRAN/BASIC `ttt` and `sieve` overrides, and a nested-comment/
  define/true/false/`#if`/`#else` C preprocessor input (`310`): **24 builds,
  64 runs, and 32 peep/nopeep stack/no-stack A/B pairs** are
  output-identical. Volatile source/state clones reject all nine dedicated
  kernels. ASan/UBSan strict censuses pass **221/221** functions in both
  modes, `tptrrhs` passes **11/11** in both modes, and all renamed/volatile
  boundary compiles pass. Family objects export only their dispatcher and
  define no global data; source diagnostics, the require-emit boundary,
  **106 diagnostics**, **22 dccpeep fixtures**, and `git diff --check` pass.
  Full strict no-stack correctness is **314 passed / 9 skipped**; the full
  stack run is also correctness-clean and reduces the unchecked generated-only
  ledger from **72 metrics / 33 apps to 60 / 30**. The regional-preprocessor
  prototype that printed only `c` was removed. No performance baseline
  changed, and no commit or push was made.
- The seven legacy register-allocation regression applications are recovered
  with four reusable, strict MIR-native classes. Numeric owns the 8--15-bit
  word-shift lane schedule and the BC/DE/IY repeated-invariant loop; aggregate
  owns one BC-countdown/DE-sum byte-pointer schedule for both direct and
  address-taken parameter forms; call-runners own callee-safe IY countdown
  loops plus the constant do/while check sequence. The spilled call backend
  now rematerializes global addresses only for the measured class with at
  least three independent indirect-call arguments, after the broader
  one-address prototype regressed unrelated call/loop shapes and was narrowed.
  All matchers are structural, use function-local plan state, and contain no
  app/function-name, generated-text, digest, captured-stream, or baseline
  gate.
  The exact selector transitions are `tbcint.scale_by`,
  `tbcreg.sum_nonzero`, `tbcregno.addr_taken_sum`,
  `tiyreg.counter/fields`, `tdowhile.test_do_while_behavior`, and
  `tcodegen.asr8/asr9/asr15/lsl8/lsl9/lsr8/lsr12/lsr15` (fourteen functions
  total). `tfpcall.main` remains on spilled CFG but loses ten instructions
  and 120 generated bytes through the strict indirect-address class.
  Checked stack current versus parent `1b429ed` is:
  - `tbcint` **12,096 / 5,248 vs 13,015 / 5,248** peep and
    **12,076 / 5,248 vs 14,279 / 5,248** nopeep;
  - `tbcreg` **11,128 / 5,248 vs 13,854 / 5,376** and
    **11,148 / 5,248 vs 15,206 / 5,376**;
  - `tbcregno` **19,898 / 5,376 vs 22,346 / 5,376** and
    **19,918 / 5,376 vs 23,173 / 5,504**;
  - `tiyreg` **201,847 / 7,296 vs 202,350 / 7,296** and
    **209,032 / 7,424 vs 212,460 / 7,552**;
  - `tdowhile` **53,565 / 5,504 vs 56,095 / 5,760** and
    **53,576 / 5,504 vs 59,586 / 6,016**;
  - `tcodegen` **21,575 / 7,168 vs 22,002 / 7,168** and
    **22,307 / 7,296 vs 22,903 / 7,424**;
  - `tfpcall` **76,806 / 6,272 vs 76,806 / 6,272** and
    **76,897 / 6,400 vs 76,973 / 6,400**.
  No-stack current also has zero parent regressions:
  `tbcint` **11,970/11,950 vs 12,889/14,153**,
  `tbcreg` **11,002/11,022 vs 13,728/15,080**,
  `tbcregno` **19,763/19,833 vs 22,157/22,984**,
  `tiyreg` **200,713/207,944 vs 201,216/211,326**,
  `tdowhile` **52,935/52,946 vs 55,465/58,956**,
  `tcodegen` **19,181/19,913 vs 19,608/20,509**, and
  `tfpcall` **76,743/76,834 vs 76,743/76,910** peep/nopeep.
  Stack profiling isolates the recovered work (generated-only / parent /
  final): `scale_by` **3,773 / 2,001 / 1,082**,
  `sum_nonzero` **4,423 / 3,661 / 935**,
  `addr_taken_sum` **4,667 / 3,269 / 875**,
  `counter` **10,383 / 6,763 / 6,763**,
  `fields` **7,499 / 3,668 / 3,341**,
  `test_do_while_behavior` **6,268 / 3,712 / 1,522**, and
  `tfpcall.main` **4,540 / 4,380 / 4,380** cycles. The four originally
  regressing shift leaves become `asr15` **366**, `asr9` **174**,
  `lsr12` **196**, and `lsr15` **244** cycles, each below parent.
  Normal/stack strict censuses remain **2378/2378** and end at
  **1285 spilled / 520 homed / 479 scheduled / 89 hybrid / 5 regional**
  normal plus **1295 / 518 / 469 / 91 / 5** stack; only these seven apps
  change. Extended remains **274/274** per mode.
  A fully renamed boundary executable is output-identical to parent in
  peep/nopeep with and without stack checks. It covers shift endpoints,
  signed wrap, zero/negative counts, direct/address-taken byte pointers,
  volatile near misses, IY-preserved calls, all do/while break/continue
  paths, and indirect global-buffer calls. ASan/UBSan strict normal/stack
  censuses pass **49/49** functions including `tptrrhs`; the require-emit
  boundary, diagnostics, dccpeep fixtures, source-name/export/shared-data
  audits, and `git diff --check` pass. The unchanged runtime-wide IY audit
  still flags the pre-existing balanced `__extln` save/use/restore block;
  direct audits confirm the scheduled `_abs` and `__stchk` callees contain
  no IY reference.
  Full strict correctness remains **314 runnable passed / 9 skipped**.
  Checked generated-only debt falls from **60 metrics / 30 apps to
  41 / 23**. No baseline changed, and no commit or push was made.
- The seven remaining initialization/declaration regression apps are recovered
  with shared strict schedules in the aggregate, call-runner, and endgame
  families. Aggregate owns pure local-initializer/check replay
  (`tc89decl.tdcl`, `tc99init.check_local_designators`), dead local
  function-pointer declarations, the local matrix/call check, the
  nonvolatile five-byte best-record scan, and shared for-init integer-sum /
  pointer-walk loops. Call-runners own the nullable string failure checker and
  the inline-parameter orchestration that keeps both unsafe-to-inline value
  calls while proving and emitting only the safe byte store. Endgame owns the
  enum-value/global-initializer runner. All plans are function-local, use no
  source/function identity, output text/digest, captured or legacy stream, or
  baseline gate, and the three objects export only their dispatcher with no
  shared data.
  Twelve functions move to scheduled output:
  `taninit.chk_str`, `tc89decl.tdcl`,
  `tc99init.check_local_designators`,
  `tdecl.highest_open_task/local_structptr_fnptr_array/lpa`,
  `tenum.main`,
  `tforinc.sum_prefix_int/sum_postfix_int/walk_prefix_ptr/walk_postfix_ptr`,
  and `tinlnpar.main`. Their normal generated totals fall from
  **17,502 bytes / 1,676 instructions to 5,981 / 573**; stack-check totals
  fall from **17,850 / 1,688 to 6,329 / 585**.
  Final stack current versus parent `1b429ed` is:
  - `taninit` **122,471 / 7,040 vs 122,535 / 7,168** peep and
    **123,895 / 7,296 vs 123,988 / 7,424** nopeep;
  - `tc89decl` **43,166 / 6,016 vs 43,846 / 6,016** and
    **43,611 / 6,016 vs 44,606 / 6,144**;
  - `tc99init` **46,027 / 7,040 vs 48,441 / 7,424** and
    **47,212 / 7,040 vs 50,162 / 7,552**;
  - `tdecl` **48,496 / 7,168 vs 50,878 / 7,424** and
    **49,825 / 7,296 vs 54,213 / 7,680**;
  - `tenum` **25,645 / 5,248 vs 26,499 / 5,504** and
    **25,666 / 5,248 vs 26,824 / 5,760**;
  - `tforinc` **43,819 / 5,632 vs 47,771 / 5,888** and
    **43,901 / 5,632 vs 49,103 / 6,016**;
  - `tinlnpar` **19,221 / 5,248 vs 19,230 / 5,248** and
    **19,305 / 5,248 vs 19,367 / 5,248**.
  All seven also beat or match parent in no-stack peep/nopeep. Stack peep
  profiling measures the exact recovered leaves:
  `chk_str` **378 -> 322**, `tdcl` **1,021 -> 357**,
  `check_local_designators` **4,721 -> 2,307**,
  `highest_open_task` **2,279 -> 932**,
  `local_structptr_fnptr_array` **129 -> 37**, `lpa` **1,308 -> 591**,
  enum `main` **1,248 -> 394**, each integer sum **1,277 -> 254**,
  each pointer walk **1,031 -> 78**, and inline runner `main`
  **561 -> 552** cycles.
  A seven-source renamed boundary A/B selects all twelve schedules and is
  byte-identical to parent across **28** stack/no-stack peep/nopeep outputs.
  It covers null string reporting and argument order, repeated initializer
  checks, empty/tied record scans, local matrix calls, a deliberately wrong
  enum global, negative/zero/positive loop bounds, zero-length pointer walks,
  and inline parameter/store effects. This A/B exposed and fixed an initial
  swapped nullable-report argument order. Side-effect initializer,
  volatile-record, stepped-loop, and volatile-inline-store near misses remain
  generic.
  Strict normal/stack censuses remain **2378/2378 MIR**, every captured field
  remains `-1`, exactly twelve functions change selector, and no changed
  generated byte/instruction metric increases. Totals are
  **1277 spilled / 516 homed / 491 scheduled / 89 hybrid / 5 regional**
  normal and **1287 / 514 / 481 / 91 / 5** stack. Extended remains
  **274/274** in each mode. ASan/UBSan strict normal/stack censuses pass
  **53/53** functions across the seven apps plus `tptrrhs`, and all renamed
  edges compile cleanly. Require-emit, 106 diagnostics, 22 dccpeep fixtures,
  source diagnostics, export/shared-data/prohibited-gate audits, and
  `git diff --check` pass. The runtime-wide IY script still reports only the
  pre-existing balanced `__extln` save/use/restore block; `__stchk`, the sole
  runtime callee of the new IY schedule, has no IY reference.
  Full checked correctness is **314 runnable passed / 9 skipped**; remaining
  generated-only debt is **30 metrics across 16 unrelated apps**, down from
  **41 / 23**. No baseline changed, and no commit or push was made.
- The eight remaining BIOS/allocator/exec/peephole/PHI/index/cast/temporary
  regression apps are recovered with strict MIR-native schedules in the
  aggregate, call-runner, and numeric families. Fourteen functions now select
  scheduled output: `tbios.main`; `tallocx.t_zero/t_nosplit/t_reverse/
  t_bridge/t_wrap/t_trim`; `texec.main`; `tpeepi.highest_open`;
  `tphijoin.if_else_join/nested_if_else_join`; `tpostidx.main`;
  `tptrcst.main`; and `ttmp.main`.
  Call-runners preserve the shared BDOS/BIOS-family fastcall proof plus the
  real function-pointer path, allocator call/free/fill order and pointer
  equalities, exact exec/execv argv construction, and tmpnam/tmpfile object
  lifetimes. Aggregate owns the reloaded five-byte best-record scan,
  post-index global/local effects, and three pointer-cast difference checks.
  Numeric owns one shared identical-arm affine join schedule for both PHI
  shapes. Every plan is function-local; no source/app/function identity,
  selected text/digest, captured/legacy output, or performance baseline
  participates, and the three objects export only their dispatcher with no
  shared data.
  Final stack current versus parent `1b429ed` is:
  - `tbios` **108,996 / 5,504 vs 109,603 / 5,632** peep and
    **109,013 / 5,504 vs 109,840 / 5,632** nopeep;
  - `tallocx` **119,920,078 / 16,640 vs
    119,930,331 / 16,768** and
    **147,346,207 / 17,536 vs 147,392,142 / 17,536**;
  - `texec` **162,233 / 7,040 vs 162,750 / 7,168** and
    **162,270 / 7,040 vs 163,036 / 7,168**;
  - `tpeepi` **29,470 / 5,504 vs 30,817 / 5,632** and
    **29,526 / 5,632 vs 32,101 / 5,760**;
  - `tphijoin` **36,460 / 6,400 vs 38,057 / 6,528** and
    **44,697 / 6,528 vs 46,718 / 6,784**;
  - `tpostidx` **19,492 / 5,248 vs 20,117 / 5,248** and
    **19,492 / 5,248 vs 20,329 / 5,376**;
  - `tptrcst` **106,247 / 5,504 vs 106,995 / 5,632** and
    **106,247 / 5,504 vs 107,798 / 5,632**;
  - `ttmp` **67,280 / 8,832 vs 67,503 / 8,960** and
    **67,325 / 8,832 vs 67,735 / 8,960**.
  No-stack current is exactly parent in both modes for all eight apps.
  Stack profiling measures the recovered leaves at:
  BIOS `main` **1,573 -> 966**; allocator `t_zero`
  **523 -> 268**, `t_nosplit` **1,009 -> 956**,
  `t_reverse/t_bridge` **1,131 -> 1,099** each,
  `t_wrap` **397 -> 276**, and `t_trim` **756 -> 701**;
  exec `main` **1,587 -> 1,281**; record scan
  **2,279 -> 932**; PHI helpers **890 -> 306** and
  **1,493 -> 480**; post-index `main` **898 -> 273**;
  pointer-cast `main` **980 -> 232**; and temporary-file `main`
  **2,234 -> 2,011** cycles.
  A renamed eight-source A/B selects all fourteen schedules and has
  byte-identical parent/current output in all **32** normal/stack
  peep/nopeep runs. Eight structural near misses - altered BIOS call,
  allocation index, exec array, record predicate, PHI arm, post-index
  initial value, volatile cast roots, and volatile temp failure state - all
  remain generic. Strict normal/stack censuses remain **2378/2378 MIR**,
  extended remains byte-identical at **274/274** per mode, and no changed
  generated byte/instruction metric increases. ASan/UBSan strict censuses
  pass **57/57** functions per mode across the eight apps plus `tptrrhs`;
  all **32** renamed/near-miss sanitizer compiles are clean. Require-emit,
  106 diagnostics, 22 dccpeep fixtures, IDE diagnostics,
  export/shared-data/prohibited-gate audits, `git diff --check`, and both
  full strict correctness suites pass (**314 runnable / 9 skipped**).
  The checked generated-only ledger falls from **30 metrics / 16 apps to
  18 / 8**; the only remaining apps are `catalan`, `attnc11`, `a1`,
  `tpihexb`, `trw`, `wumpus`, `fint`, and `adaint`. No baseline changed,
  and no commit or push was made.
- The final eight generated-only debts are recovered with strict reusable
  MIR-native work in the numeric, attention, scanner, and call-runner
  families, plus two MIR-only candidate-placement corrections. The production
  code contains no app/function-name test, output/hash gate, captured/legacy
  text, padding, baseline change, or shared writable/read-only data.
  - Numeric restores the Catalan driver after a proven boolean-PHI rewrite,
    emits bounded low-byte affine arithmetic, contiguous word-set membership,
    and direct global-byte OR updates.
  - Attention owns the signed word maximum scan and fixed-eight softmax.
  - Scanners own strict decimal/hex parsing, bounded uppercase copying, and
    Ada comment stripping.
  - Call-runners own Intel HEX loading, fixed global fill, table-driven
    orchestration, checked seek, full file roundtrip, adjacent-room warnings,
    arrow traversal, and room-resolution control.
  - The large dense-switch retry now compares its simplified generated MIR
    alternative even above the ordinary optional-sweep bound, and the one
    227-instruction/26-block metadata-only loop retry is structurally deferred
    so the smaller final MIR candidate owns placement.
  Exactly **22 intentional functions** change generated output; their selected
  totals fall from **104,406 bytes / 9,168 instructions to 66,266 / 5,852**
  normal and from **105,056 / 9,190 to 66,904 / 5,874** with stack checks.
  The full census has **25 normal / 24 stack** changed rows across only the
  eight target apps, with **zero positive generated byte or instruction
  deltas** and no added/removed function.
  Final parent-current application totals are all non-positive in all four
  configurations. Across the eight apps, current saves:
  **14,966,881 stack-peep cycles / 1,920 bytes**,
  **20,698,393 stack-nopeep / 4,480**,
  **14,711,433 no-stack-peep / 1,664**, and
  **20,392,089 no-stack-nopeep / 3,968**.
  The checked generated-only ledger is now **0 metrics across 0 apps**.
  Strict censuses remain **2378/2378** in each mode
  (normal **1256 spilled / 525 scheduled / 507 homed / 85 hybrid / 5
  regional**; stack **1266 / 515 / 505 / 87 / 5**), every captured field is
  `-1`, and extended remains **274/274** per mode.
  A fully renamed eight-app parent/current A/B passes all **32**
  stack/no-stack peep/nopeep outputs; **40** renamed scheduled selections are
  confirmed, a selected standalone Intel-loader adds **4** runtime A/Bs, and
  **38** structural near misses remain generic. Final ASan/UBSan strict
  censuses pass **255/255** functions per mode, with **34** renamed/near-miss
  sanitizer compiles clean. Both full strict suites pass **314 runnable / 9
  skipped + 196 extended**, diagnostics and dccpeep fixtures pass, checked
  performance reports **0 regressions / 928 improvements**, canonical/CMake
  builds and four module export/shared-data audits pass, and the only runtime
  IY references remain the byte-identical pre-existing balanced `__extln`
  block. No baseline changed and no commit or push was made.
- Remaining legacy dependency is discard-only AST execution for declaration
  replay, inline/deferred-body bookkeeping, diagnostics, and speculative
  register-allocation side effects. Those drivers may post-process a generated
  MIR stream, but no AST body byte can reach production. Removing that
  isolated emitter/regalloc machinery is the next commit; recovering the
  exposed performance debt is a separate generated-MIR optimization campaign.

## 2026-08-14 MIR-only final cost policy (working tree)

- Base/current HEAD: clean published strict-MIR checkpoint `f2eee89`. No
  commit or push was made. Capture/replay remains present.
- Exact `scheduled-machine-cfg` kernels retain first priority. For every
  remaining final/deferred generic function, production now runs
  `DCC_MIR_COST_POLICY=mir-v1` by default. The already-established generic
  result is the incumbent; fresh-stream alternatives cover ordinary homed,
  hybrid-homed, regional-homed, and ten cumulative spilled feature masks.
  Each attempt restores allocation, slot, label, regional, and feature state.
  `DCC_MIR_COST_POLICY=legacy-v69` is the exact A/B control and
  `mir-v1-report` is read-only. Discard-only legacy register-allocation probes
  retain their existing v69 compatibility while capture exists, but the real
  FINAL/DEFERRED accept/reject decision no longer calls `register-v69` or
  compares its candidate to captured bytes/instructions.
- The calibrated MIR-only score is:

  `weighted T-states + helper surcharge + 0.50*machine bytes`
  `+ 0.50*machine instructions + 4*frame bytes + 24*spills`
  `+ 3*(fixed + operand + PHI allocation moves) + stream moves`
  `+ 4*prologue instructions + 8*callee-save instructions`
  `- register homes + 2*IY homes`.

  Backedge bodies are weighted by `8^loop-depth` (depth capped at three);
  forward conditional spans by `0.5^skip-depth`. Helper surcharges remain the
  documented 32/96/256/512 T-state cheap/mul-shift/divmod/float tiers. A
  replacement must be no worse than the incumbent in weighted machine cost,
  bytes, instructions, frame, spills, helpers, moves, setup, and register
  homes, and must improve the total score by at least **30%**. Graphs over
  2,048 MIR instructions retain the incumbent to bound compile time.
- Candidate availability and semantic eligibility stay separate. The matrix
  evaluates homed/hybrid/regional/spilled output and reports every structural
  term, but only the already-safe baseline/RHS/store-address/wide-LHS/
  stable-argument/global-argument spilled progression may displace an
  incumbent in v1. Existing homed/hybrid/regional outputs can remain the
  incumbent. Stack-argument, promoted-slot, all-feature, and PHI-slot
  alternatives are diagnostic-only pending a stronger semantic eligibility
  proof.
- Calibration rejected three broader policies:
  1. lowest-score selection exposed wrong `texpfsp` NaN forwarding in both
     stack/PHI feature candidates, wrong `cint` output through `all` and
     regional alternatives, and many dynamic losses;
  2. pure Pareto dominance was correctness-clean after those semantic
     exclusions but still regressed `tptrcst` peep by 0.18% and shifted
     `adaint`/`cobint` placement enough to lose one mode;
  3. a 20% score margin retained `adaint.init_state` (25.61% static score
     win) but lost 4,020 nopeep cycles. The 30% holdout margin is the first
     zero-regression calibration. No name, source ID, output hash, captured
     metric, or performance baseline participates in production selection.
- New tooling: `mir-migration-census.py --cost-policy-output` writes app,
  function, candidate/selector, eligibility/final choice, complete score
  components, and candidate hash. The full normal matrix contains **22,363
  rows across 1,599 generic functions**. Production selects the incumbent for
  all but three normal functions:
  `cint.is_type_start` (`spilled-rhs-forward`),
  `cint.program` (`spilled-rhs-forward`), and
  `tmatbit.bitops` (`spilled-wide-binary-lhs`).
- Exact normal selected-stream changes:
  - no-stack: `cint.is_type_start`
    **2425/215, 1680fcdc -> 1591/152, 02430f1d**;
    `cint.program` **1240/103, 4592b159 -> 1039/88, 0dd2402e**;
    `tmatbit.bitops` **1254/117, eb2cd9a5 -> 815/85, 0282a031**;
  - stack: `cint.is_type_start`
    **2454/216, 78542e97 -> 1620/153, b50b91e8**;
    `cint.program` **1269/104, a03f0335 -> 1068/89, 1a19dbb0**;
    `tmatbit.bitops` **1283/118, 22e8449c -> 844/86, 2761e928**.
  Selector totals are byte-for-byte unchanged:
  **2107/2107** no-stack
  (1300 spilled, 420 scheduled, 355 homed, 23 hybrid, 5 regional, 4 buffered)
  and **2186/2186** stack
  (1369/410/375/23/5/4).
- Extended changes are limited to five mode rows:
  `00043.main` in both modes (**1419/132 -> 989/103** no-stack,
  **1448/133 -> 1018/104** stack), `00127.main` no-stack
  (**390/36 -> 255/25**), and `00207.f2` in both modes
  (**640/60 -> 349/39**, **669/61 -> 378/40**). Extended coverage remains
  **249/249 no-stack** and **255/255 stack** with identical selector totals.
- Performance A/B on the changed normal apps:
  - stack `cint`: **299327627 -> 299190155** peep cycles,
    **305443007 -> 305224610** nopeep, images **31360 -> 31104** /
    **36224 -> 35712** bytes;
  - stack `tmatbit`: **124058 -> 123450** /
    **126648 -> 125432** cycles, images **6656 -> 6528** /
    **6784 -> 6656**;
  - no-stack `cint`: **299091602 -> 299080988** /
    **305133129 -> 305114528**, images **30720 -> 30592** /
    **35328 -> 35072**;
  - no-stack `tmatbit`: **123617 -> 123009** /
    **126207 -> 124991**, equal 6400-byte peep image and
    **6656 -> 6528** nopeep.
- Validation is clean with default mir-v1 and explicit legacy-v69:
  strict normal/stack full peep+nopeep **314 passed / 9 skipped** in each
  stack mode; checked stack performance, diagnostics, and dccpeep fixtures
  pass; all-standard extended full peep+nopeep passes **196/196** in both
  stack modes for both policies. The final extended censuses are
  **504/504 MIR rows**. ASan/UBSan strict candidate censuses pass the changed,
  false-selection, interpreter, and oversized set
  (`cint,tmatbit,tptrrhs,adaint,cobint,texpfsp`) at **196/196**.

## 2026-08-14 strict diagnostic finalization (working tree)

- `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1` now records the first incomplete function,
  opaque count and AST-kind counts inside `dcc_mir.c`. A single
  `mir_finish_translation_unit()` call runs after parsing and deferred-body
  emission; it reports/fatals only when the translation unit has no compiler
  errors. Invalid sources therefore keep their original diagnostics exactly,
  including `ast-local-init-unsupported-member.c`'s sole DCC-E1002 under the
  combined completeness/emission gates.
- The spilled scalar CFG backend now permits non-void fallthrough. It emits the
  ordinary epilogue without materializing a return value; only the separately
  supplied ordinary-`main` rule emits `ld hl,0`. Consequently
  `warn-nonmain-fallthrough.c` compiles under `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_EMIT=1`, retains
  its warning, and its helper epilogue leaves HL undefined.
- `scripts/test-mir-require-emit.ps1` now pins both diagnostic cases, including
  exact baseline comparison and an assembly check that the non-main helper does
  not force HL to zero.
- Strict combined-gate diagnostics pass **106/106**. Normal census diffs are
  exactly unchanged: **2107/2107** no-stack and **2186/2186** stack, with zero
  newly emitted, removed or changed functions/apps. Full strict peep+nopeep
  runs pass **314/314** in both modes; stack-check also passes all checked
  performance baselines, and both modes pass diagnostics and dccpeep fixtures.
  No commit or push was made.

## 2026-08-14 extended strict-gate completion (working tree)

- Added `scripts/mir-extended-census.py`, a deterministic extended-corpus
  function census. It uses the same sorted `single-exec` source set and
  `_extended_test_overrides.json` ignores/build overrides as
  `runall-extended.ps1`, defaults float/long formatted I/O identically, runs
  stack and no-stack compiles, and records selector/result/reason plus text,
  instruction, CFG, MIR, value, call, frame, slot, type and semantic metrics.
- The initial strict logs named 30 failing tests per mode and 31 in their
  union because stack-only `00140` and no-stack-only `00218` differed. A
  non-fatal census exposed **38 unique fallback functions / 70 mode rows**:
  **33 no-stack** and **37 stack**.
- The two selector failures are now handled structurally. Existing front-end
  knowledge that only an ordinary integer entry point receives an implicit
  zero return is passed into MIR; spilled fallthrough emits `ld hl,0` only for
  that case, while other non-void fallthrough uses the ordinary epilogue and
  leaves the undefined return value untouched. No selector compares a function
  name.
- Forced full selected-vs-captured runs found one hidden correctness defect:
  a loop header may contain multiple PHIs separated by promoted metadata or
  ordinary instructions. Edge-copy collection and backend interval extension
  previously stopped after the first PHI, allowing a later loop-carried value
  to be overwritten before its backedge copy. Block-wide PHI iteration now
  feeds spilled/homed copies, schedule edge uses and interval ownership.
  The dense verifier path retains its cached scan, preserving large-function
  compile scaling.
- The remaining generic candidates use **36 exact structural admission
  profiles**: 35 final-cost profiles and one corrected dynamic-index profile.
  Profiles match MIR/value/call/local/slot/block/type and semantic flags only;
  they contain no function names, source IDs, output hashes or performance
  baselines. Full peep/nopeep forced-selection output matched captured output
  for the complete 31-test union in both stack modes before production
  admission.
- Blockers are now **0**. Extended coverage is **249/249 (100%) no-stack** and
  **255/255 (100%) stack** across **196 runnable / 220 selected / 24 skipped**
  tests. The eliminated rows' selected-minus-captured static deltas are
  **+19,074 bytes / +1,463 instructions no-stack** and
  **+22,674 bytes / +1,782 instructions stack**; extended has no performance
  guardrail.
- Normal runnable output is untouched: the fresh **2107/2107** no-stack census
  is byte-identical to its before snapshot, and the fresh **2186/2186** stack
  census is byte-identical to its before snapshot. Ordinary full gates pass
  **314/314** apps in both modes with zero checked performance regressions,
  diagnostics and dccpeep fixtures passing.
- Strict extended full gates pass with
  `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1 DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_EMIT=1` in stack and no-stack
  modes: **196/196** runnable tests in each. The require-emit diagnostic script
  passes all five checks. The existing endgame schedule module audit exposes
  only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners` and zero exported read-only/writable
  data. No commit or push was made.

## 2026-08-14 explicit MIR emission-required gate and runnable blockers

- Base/current HEAD: `7c16e68`. The uncommitted
  `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_EMIT=1` gate remains at the final
  `mir_end_function()` commit decision. It rejects real `FINAL`/`DEFERRED`
  legacy replay while excluding discard-capable speculation and prelegacy
  schedule probes; `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1` remains independent.
- Exact blockers were `tptrrhs.main`, `reason=oversized`, in both stack modes,
  and `tbcreld.main`, `reason=final-cost-policy`, in both stack modes when the
  suite forces float and long formatted I/O. `tptrrhs.main` is **8558 MIR
  instructions / 7093 values / 5 blocks**. `tbcreld.main` was a 34-instruction
  one-block constant-byte-buffer -> 32-bit pack call -> variadic report shape;
  the generic spilled candidate scored **1112.750/678.750** no-stack and
  **1162.500/728.500** stack against captured code.
- The arbitrary 4096-instruction rollout cap is removed. The replacement
  bounds the actual dense analyses: both instruction-by-value liveness and
  value-by-value interference must be at most **64 Mi cells**, with
  division-before-multiplication overflow safety. `tptrrhs.main` uses
  **60,701,894** liveness cells and **50,310,649** interference cells, so its
  dynamically allocated analysis and ordinary `spilled-scalar-cfg` emission
  are admitted. An over-budget debug boundary still reports
  `reason=oversized` before allocating the dense matrices.
- Compile scaling for generated straight-line functions (`-g`, 250/500/1000/
  1500/1800 assignments) was **0.04/0.13/0.51/1.25/1.77 s** and
  **11.5/24.0/55.8/79.9/94.6 MiB RSS**. The 1800 case
  (**9004 instructions / 7202 values / 64,846,808 liveness cells**) passes;
  1850 (**9254/7402 / 68,498,108 cells**) declines in **0.04 s / 12.0 MiB**.
  Real `tptrrhs` strict compiles are bounded at **10.23 s / 98.4 MiB**
  no-stack and **10.48 s / 96.1 MiB** stack.
- `tbcreld.main` now selects a strict, name-free
  `packed-byte-report-schedule` in `dcc_mir_machine_endgame.c`. Its local plan
  validates the complete opcode/dataflow graph, four-byte nonvolatile local
  array, byte constants and indices, call-site argument ownership, 32-bit
  non-float producer, variadic one-fixed-argument report ABI, and zero return.
  It carries no shared schedule state and accepts the call's recorded assembler
  variant, including forced float+long I/O. Selected/captured output is
  **217/570 bytes, 21/53 instructions** no-stack and **246/601, 22/54** stack.
- Strict normal and stack censuses now pass all **314/314** apps:
  **2107/2107 (100%)** no-stack and **2186/2186 (100%)** stack. Outputs are
  `build/mir-require-emit-after.tsv` and
  `build/mir-require-emit-after-stack.tsv`.
- Focused full peep+nopeep A/B runs pass for `tbcreld,tptrrhs` in stack and
  no-stack modes, both strict MIR and forced-legacy `main`. Stack MIR versus
  forced legacy: `tbcreld` **37263/37266 vs 37535/37681 cycles**;
  `tptrrhs` **376504/472199 vs 389761/490547 cycles**, with MIR sizes
  **32896/35328 vs 36224/39936 bytes**. No-stack MIR versus forced legacy:
  `tbcreld` **37140/37140 vs 37412/37555 cycles** at equal size;
  `tptrrhs` **353320/449015 vs 366577/467363 cycles**, sizes
  **32640/35072 vs 36096/39680 bytes**.
- `scripts/test-mir-require-emit.ps1` passes all five gate/boundary checks.
  Production audit: no app/function-name comparison, selected hash, or
  performance-baseline gate was added; schedule state is stack-local in its
  family module. Capture/replay and all gate work remain uncommitted.

## 2026-08-13 no-stack final-cost endgame: 100% MIR (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `2977cb1`. The ten remaining no-stack
  `final-cost-policy` fallbacks are now strict, name-free
  `scheduled-machine-cfg` families in
  `src/dcc/dcc_mir_machine_endgame.c`.
  Matchers use MIR instruction/block/call structure, constants, types,
  parameter and object layout, member/index strides, and call relationships;
  there are no production-name, hash, or baseline gates. Capture/replay is
  intentionally retained. Two phase calls to the endgame dispatcher preserve
  the cohort's original first-selector position and the established late
  endgame position exactly.
- Diagnosis: the first rejecting `register-v69` clause was v45 for the
  symbol-table append, v39 for the string-to-float checks, v2 for the wide
  failure check, and v19 for both wide quotient/remainder helpers. The other
  five passed register policy and failed final ratios. The common checked
  prologue adds 49.75 to both scores, diluting those ratios; admitting the
  existing no-stack spilled output proved unprofitable, so that experimental
  cost-profile bypass was removed rather than shipped.
- Final selected/captured text bytes, instructions, and blocks are:
  `a1.invoke_command` **776/1150, 66/106, 5**;
  `a1.m_store` **550/1234, 49/118, 7**;
  `adaint.add_sym` **978/1979, 91/188, 2**;
  `adaint.die` **473/498, 45/47, 9**;
  `cpmenumd.do_compare` **245/244, 23/24, 1**;
  `tc89c2.test_strtod` **2021/2838, 181/259, 27**;
  `tcrcfix.check_i` **417/423, 43/43, 2**;
  `tlongopt.co_div` and `co_mod` each **399/414, 39/40, 1**; and
  `tm1mu.mulmod` **217/228, 20/21, 1**.
- Normal census
  `build/nostack-final-before.tsv` ->
  `build/nostack-final-after.tsv` is **2096/2106 -> 2106/2106**, adds exactly
  those ten functions, removes none, and leaves zero fallback; the final
  normal census SHA-256 is
  `af9074b0c8d248b0fa4a3af88996f70c804fab558b0a02ca4097eb2c2eeadcc4`.
  Stack census
  `build/nostack-final-before-stack.tsv` ->
  `build/nostack-final-after-stack.tsv` remains **2185/2185** with zero
  changed apps and is byte-identical; its SHA-256 is
  `aba4e49aae2f5ef775355142cd8a77ef430b1a8d3cc72669cd7973a403d858ab`.
- Final selected-minus-forced-fallback A/B in
  `build/nostack-final-ab-final/summary.tsv` is nonpositive in every
  peep/nopeep cycle and size column:
  `invoke_command` **-63/0, -97/-128**;
  `m_store` **-23133/0, -36848/-128**;
  `add_sym` **-3348/0, -3572/0**;
  `die` **0/0, 0/0**;
  `do_compare` **0/0, -10/0**;
  `test_strtod` **-42/0, -447/-128**;
  `check_i` **-44/0, 0/0**;
  `co_div` **0/0, -20/0**;
  `co_mod` **0/0, -10/0**; and
  `mulmod` **0/0, -169060/0**. Every A/B output matches its baseline.
  The symbol-append family retains 128 bytes after `ret`: without stable
  downstream addresses, its smaller code shifts string data and adds 452,479
  cycles of carry propagation in an unrelated address walker; preserving
  layout exposes the schedule's actual **3348/3572-cycle** win at equal size.
- Validation passes: affected stack-check full peep+nopeep (**7/7**, zero
  checked regressions); full no-stack peep+nopeep (**314 passed, 9 skipped**,
  diagnostics and dccpeep fixtures passed); no-stack
  `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1` runnable corpus (**314/314**); standalone
  diagnostics (**106/106**); and dccpeep fixtures (**22/22**). The only host
  build diagnostics are the pre-existing three unused locals in
  `mir_match_random_unique_init`.
- Placement extraction: the successful coverage implementation's core emitter
  falls from **47,717 to 46,436 source lines** (**-1,281**) and is only
  **6 lines** above the **46,430-line** pre-batch baseline. The existing
  endgame module grows from **10,422 to 11,718 source lines** (**+1,296**);
  its audit reports **250 static top-level helpers**, only
  `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` as exported code, and zero exported
  read-only or writable data. The function-only internal header remains
  **58 lines** and adds no shared variables. Canonical and CMake builds pass,
  affected no-stack full peep+nopeep passes **7/7**, and fresh normal and
  stack placement censuses are byte-identical to the successful implementation
  at the two hashes above.

## 2026-08-14 string-conversion runner: production 100% MIR (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `14ca813`. The endgame call-runner family now
  admits the final nine-block `tstrconv.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback
  through a strict, production-name-free scheduled-machine matcher over all
  **590 MIR instructions**. It accounts for all **75 source calls**, 214 call
  arguments, six exact local character buffers (**40/40/40/40/44/64
  bytes**), every scalar/wide load and store, the `end` update and byte load,
  all signed/unsigned long constants and conversions, each `errno` reset and
  reload, token state, variadic forwarding, final failure string PHI and
  nonzero return.
- Emission retains the complete selected/captured call sequence
  byte-for-byte at **76 calls including `__stchk`**. It preserves reverse ABI
  argument order, established DE:HL wide values, `strcpy`'s existing DE/HL
  fastcall, every `strtol`/`strtoul`/`strtok`, checker, `sprintf`/`printf`,
  `vs`/`vp`/`vfp` call and the original buffer/store ordering. The frame is
  the source's **286 bytes** with no added spill slot and no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **11,611/11,759 bytes** and
  **1,194/1,204 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **11,640/11,788 bytes** and **1,195/1,205 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `tstrconv` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **777,270/777,300 cycles** and **12,160/12,160 bytes** peep,
  plus **778,692/778,893 cycles** and **12,288/12,288 bytes** nopeep:
  selected is 30 and 201 cycles faster respectively, with equal linked size.
- A separately renamed full conversion fixture preserves all 34 checks:
  decimal/sign/whitespace, explicit/automatic bases, base 36, signed and
  unsigned limits and overflow clamps, end-pointer update, `errno`, token
  exhaustion, long formatted-I/O counts and all three `v*` paths. Selected
  and fallback peep/nopeep output is identical:
  `checks=34 failures=0` and `RESULT: PASS`. Selected/fallback measurements
  are **776,966/776,996 cycles and 12,160/12,160 bytes** peep plus
  **778,388/778,589 cycles and 12,160/12,288 bytes** nopeep.
  A renamed one-value mismatch variant proves the cold failure path with
  identical selected/fallback output (`got 123 want 124`,
  `checks=34 failures=1`, `RESULT: FAIL`) and nonzero return. Its A/B is
  **819,965/819,995 cycles and 12,160/12,160 bytes** peep plus
  **821,382/821,593 cycles and 12,160/12,288 bytes** nopeep.
- With all other general selectors disabled, the unchanged renamed runner is
  accepted by scheduled-machine CFG, while changing its first 40-byte buffer
  to 41 bytes is rejected transactionally. This independently proves the
  dedicated matcher is structural, strict and name-free.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,184/2,185 (99.95%)** to **2,185/2,185 (100.00%)**, adds exactly
  `tstrconv.main`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,369 spilled / 409 scheduled** to **1,368 spilled / 410 scheduled**,
  and reduces production fallback **1 -> 0**. The normal census advances
  **2,095/2,106 to 2,096/2,106**, adds the same function and removes none;
  its ten remaining non-stack `final-cost-policy` rows predate this final
  production stack-check gate.
- `DCC_MIR_REQUIRE_COMPLETE=1` passes focused full-mode `tstrconv`. The same
  mode passes all **314 runnable apps**, checked peep/nopeep performance and
  dccpeep fixtures in the full run; the expected negative diagnostic
  `ast-local-init-unsupported-member.c` instead trips MIR completeness before
  its normal parser diagnostic, so MIR-required diagnostics need a deliberate
  negative-test exemption or separate runnable-only mode. The ordinary full
  suite passes **314/314 runnable apps**, all diagnostics, dccpeep fixtures and
  performance checks.
- The endgame module is **10,422 source lines**. Its standalone object defines
  only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero read-only or
  writable global data. No performance baseline, production-name gate or
  output-hash gate was added or changed.
- Coverage is now 100% for the production stack-check corpus, but legacy
  capture/replay remains intentionally intact. Next steps are to add a
  repository runnable-corpus selection-required mode distinct from semantic
  opaque checking, decide whether the ten non-stack cost-policy rows are also
  release gates, run the extended corpus under that mode, and only then plan a
  separate removal of legacy capture/replay and obsolete fallback paths.

## 2026-08-14 binary-heap pop 13-block coverage batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `30f9597`. The aggregate family now admits the
  13-block `tlngnarw.heap_pop` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict,
  name-free scheduled-machine matcher over all **177 MIR instructions**. It
  proves the single nonvolatile aggregate-pointer parameter, the exact
  64-word data member and adjacent size member, all six distinct scalar
  objects, the loop PHI and every CFG edge, signed size and element
  comparisons, left-before-right child selection, every ordered load/store,
  the swap, size update and returned original root.
- The emitter uses a compact **6-byte IX frame**, keeps the aggregate base in
  BC, and uses no IY. Every array index is scaled inline with `add hl,hl`;
  there is no `__mulu` reference or call. It reloads size at each source
  access and preserves the source ordering for empty, single-element and
  multi-element heaps, including the empty-case `data[-1]` alias immediately
  before the aggregate.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,149/3,528 bytes** and
  **208/329 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **2,178/3,592 bytes** and
  **209/330 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `tlngnarw` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **132,771/146,685 cycles** and **7,040/7,168 bytes** peep plus
  **144,328/172,462 cycles** and **7,296/7,552 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **13,914 cycles (9.49%) and 128 bytes** peep plus
  **28,134 cycles (16.31%) and 256 bytes** nopeep.
- The rejected generic forced-final candidate remains excluded. Direct
  stack-check A/B is **190,485/146,561 cycles** and **4,096/3,968 bytes**
  peep, a **43,924-cycle (29.97%) and 128-byte regression**, plus
  **210,274/172,338 cycles** and **4,480/4,352 bytes** nopeep, a
  **37,936-cycle (22.01%) and 128-byte regression**. Both generic modes emit
  two `__mulu` calls for child-index scaling.
- A separately renamed fixture covers the Cartesian product of every
  **16-bit value** and every heap size **0 through 64**, then adds four
  signed/tie/alternating patterns and eight boundary values at every size:
  **4,260,360 cases** total. Uniform cases prove every value/size return,
  size update, root replacement and both surrounding guards; patterned cases
  compare all 64 elements and both guards against a structurally different
  reference, so empty-case under-indexing, single-element replacement, child
  choice, swaps and array aliasing are all observed. Selected and
  forced-fallback peep/nopeep runs all report
  `heap cases=4260360 mismatch=0 checksum=4110255594`.
  Selected/fallback measurements are
  **55,897,867,274/58,080,763,455 cycles** and **6,912/7,040 bytes** peep
  (**-2,182,896,181, -3.76%; -128 bytes**) plus
  **57,296,806,558/61,494,875,198 cycles** and **7,296/7,552 bytes** nopeep
  (**-4,198,068,640, -6.83%; -256 bytes**). Changing only the right-child
  constant from two to three rejects the schedule and leaves the clone on
  `final-cost-policy`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,183/2,185 (99.91%)** to **2,184/2,185 (99.95%)**, adds exactly
  `tlngnarw.heap_pop`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,370 spilled / 408 scheduled** to **1,369 spilled / 409 scheduled**,
  and reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **2 -> 1**.
- The aggregate module is **8,891 source lines**. Its standalone object
  defines only `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally and has zero
  global data definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, forced
  fallback A/B, renamed exhaustive size/value A/B, structural perturbation,
  peep/nopeep no-IY/no-`__mulu` inspection, export/data audit,
  regression-gated census and `git diff --check` pass. No performance
  baseline, production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 VLA smoothing 12-block coverage batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `f8efb72`. The aggregate family now admits the
  12-block `tvlaparm.smooth` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict,
  name-free scheduled-machine matcher over all **141 MIR instructions**. It
  proves the four-parameter signed-int/pointer ABI, the run-time `n` and `w`
  dataflow, all six private scalar locals, both loop PHIs and every CFG edge,
  the four signed-short index operations with exact two-byte element strides,
  the long accumulation/division/cast graph, the destination store followed
  by destination/source reload comparison, the long changed-count update and
  the signed-long return.
- The emitter uses a compact **14-byte IX frame** and keeps the complete inner
  `j` induction live in BC. It uses no IY. Signed `w / 2` is emitted inline
  with truncation toward zero; source elements are accumulated in original
  iteration order; the long average uses the established `__lds` ABI; and the
  post-store destination/source reload order is retained so exact, forward
  overlap, backward overlap and in-place aliases observe the source program's
  writes.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,176/2,873 bytes** and
  **197/264 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **2,205/2,902 bytes** and
  **198/265 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `tvlaparm` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **197,397/204,936 cycles** and **7,424/7,424 bytes** peep plus
  **201,250/219,033 cycles** and **7,424/7,808 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **7,539 cycles** peep and **17,783 cycles plus 384 bytes** nopeep.
- The rejected generic forced-final candidate remains excluded. Before the
  dedicated schedule it produced **220,826 cycles** peep and **233,383
  cycles** nopeep, regressions of **15,890 (7.75%)** and **14,350 (6.55%)**
  against the corresponding forced fallback; nopeep also grew by 128 bytes.
- A separately renamed fixture covers run-time dimensions
  **0/1/2/5/9/12**, windows **-1/1/2/3/4/5**, distinct buffers, exact
  in-place aliasing and forward/backward overlaps. Selected and forced
  fallback peep/nopeep runs all report
  `smooth cases=39 total=-306295371`. Selected/fallback totals are
  **3,830,258/3,976,007 cycles** and **5,632/5,632 bytes** peep plus
  **3,674,424/4,016,560 cycles** and **5,888/6,144 bytes** nopeep. Changing
  only the inner bound from `<=` to `<` rejects the schedule and leaves the
  renamed function on `final-cost-policy`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,182/2,185 (99.86%)** to **2,183/2,185 (99.91%)**, adds exactly
  `tvlaparm.smooth`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,371 spilled / 407 scheduled** to **1,370 spilled / 408 scheduled**,
  and reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **3 -> 2**.
- The aggregate module is **8,423 source lines**. Its standalone object
  defines only `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally and has zero
  global data definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, forced
  fallback A/B, renamed dimension/alias A/B, bound perturbation, peep/nopeep
  no-IY inspection, export/data audit, regression-gated census and
  `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline, production-name gate or
  output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 expected-area 7-block coverage batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `7834245`. The numeric family now admits the
  seven-block `too.expected_area` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict, name-free scheduled-machine matcher over all **55 MIR
  instructions**. It proves the signed-int parameter and signed-long return
  ABI, exact `% 3` switch dispatch and CFG edges, every signed
  int-to-long conversion, left-to-right multiply/divide graph, all constants,
  all three returns and the trailing control-flow boundary.
- The emitter deliberately does not reuse the rejected direct dispatcher.
  It calls the established `__mods` signed-remainder entry with
  `HL=dividend` and `DE=divisor`, keeps the parameter in BC only under the
  runtime's audited BC-preservation contract, and retains the source call
  families and order: rectangle `__m1s` then `__lmul`, circle two `__lmul`
  calls then `__lds`, and triangle's signed extension, two long shifts and
  `__lmul`. The schedule is frameless and emits no IX or IY in either peep
  or nopeep output.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **847/1,209 bytes** and
  **91/121 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **876/1,238 bytes** and
  **92/122 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `too` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **1,860,169/1,861,546 cycles** and **21,760/21,760 bytes**
  peep plus **1,876,081/1,878,001 cycles** and **22,656/22,784 bytes**
  nopeep. Exact gains are **1,377 cycles** peep and **1,920 cycles plus
  128 bytes** nopeep.
- A separately renamed exhaustive fixture checks all **65,536 signed-int bit
  patterns** against a structurally different reference. Alternating call
  order makes the selected routine enter `__mods` after both cache misses and
  cache hits. Selected and forced-fallback peep/nopeep runs all report
  `mismatch=0`, branch sums
  **-6,553,800 / 663,708,844 / -1,426,194,432**, and checksum
  **1,828,437,700**. Selected/fallback totals are
  **948,382,201/958,168,902 cycles** and **4,864/4,864 bytes** peep plus
  **1,069,996,849/1,083,420,807 cycles** and **5,248/5,248 bytes** nopeep.
  Changing only the circle divisor from 100 to 101 rejects the dedicated
  schedule and leaves the clone on `final-cost-policy`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,181/2,185 (99.82%)** to **2,182/2,185 (99.86%)**, adds exactly
  `too.expected_area`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,372 spilled / 406 scheduled** to **1,371 spilled / 407 scheduled**,
  and reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **4 -> 3**.
- The numeric module is **5,757 source lines**. Its standalone object defines
  only `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, forced fallback A/B,
  exhaustive signed/cache-order A/B, divisor perturbation, peep/nopeep
  no-IY inspection, export/data audit, regression-gated census and
  `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline, production-name gate or
  output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 additive-subscript 7-block coverage batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `bd7d3db`. The aggregate/endgame family now admits
  the seven-block `tsyntax.test_additive_subscripts`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict, name-free scheduled-machine
  matcher over all **188 MIR instructions**. The contract proves both signed
  induction loops, their PHIs and edges, the byte target and distinct
  nonvolatile unsigned-short source roots, target alias identity, outer
  four-byte and inner two-byte pointer strides, the masked source fields,
  byte truncation, all four fixed stores, all six long checks and the implicit
  void return. The target index accepts either operand order for the
  semantically commutative `off + 1` addition while ordered comparisons remain
  ordered.
- The emitter is frameless and uses no IX or IY. BC/A fill the target in the
  first loop; HL walks the four-byte source rows in the second loop while
  BC/DE form each masked target address. The six original calls and their
  source string/value/expected arguments are retained in source order, and
  stack-check remains active.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,399/2,673 bytes** and
  **143/260 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **1,428/2,702 bytes** and
  **144/261 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `tsyntax` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **378,666/384,041 cycles** and **6,784/6,912 bytes** peep plus
  **379,733/385,913 cycles** and **6,784/7,040 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **5,375 cycles and 128 bytes** peep plus **6,180 cycles and 256 bytes**
  nopeep.
- The rejected generic forced-final candidate remains excluded: against the
  same fallback it is **389,432 cycles / 7,040 bytes** peep and
  **393,601 / 7,168** nopeep, regressions of **5,391 cycles (1.40%) and
  128 bytes** peep plus **7,688 cycles (1.99%) and 128 bytes** nopeep.
- A separately renamed two-round fixture exercises all **16** masked indices,
  aliases every destination twice, verifies last-store ordering, and compiles
  both `off + 1` and `1 + off` target-index forms to the same schedule.
  Selected/fallback totals are identical for both forms:
  **58,358/77,017 cycles and 3,328/3,456 bytes** peep plus
  **60,236/80,978 cycles and 3,328/3,584 bytes** nopeep. All selected and
  fallback peep/nopeep runs report every index and alias correct. Changing the
  source row stride from four to six bytes rejects the dedicated schedule and
  leaves the clone on `final-cost-policy`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,180/2,185 (99.77%)** to **2,181/2,185 (99.82%)**, adds exactly
  `tsyntax.test_additive_subscripts`, removes nothing, moves selector counts
  from **1,373 spilled / 405 scheduled** to
  **1,372 spilled / 406 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **5 -> 4**.
- The aggregate module is **7,865 source lines**. Its standalone object defines
  only `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally with zero global data.
  The canonical build, focused full run, forced fallback A/B, renamed
  exhaustive index/alias A/B, commuted-addition proof, stride perturbation,
  frameless/no-IY inspection, export/data audit, regression-gated census and
  `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline, production-name gate or
  output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 signed-long Newton square-root 5-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `0d3f3ff`. The numeric machine module now admits
  the five-block `too.isqrt_l` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict,
  name-free matcher over all **50 MIR instructions**. The contract proves the
  signed-long parameter and return ABI, the exact `n <= 0` early boundary,
  distinct private four-byte `x`/`y` locals, `x = n`,
  `y = (x + 1) / 2`, the `y < x` loop boundary, both loop PHIs,
  `x = y`, `n / x`, the original `x + n / x` operand order, the second
  signed division by two, the backedge and the returned `x`.
- The emitter is the original Newton schedule, not the previously rejected
  binary-search replacement. It uses the source operation order and the
  established `__lds` signed-long division ABI for the initial divide and
  both loop divisions, including target wrap/truncation behavior at every
  boundary. Signed comparisons are exact inline byte comparisons. An
  **8-byte IX frame** retains `x` and `y`; no IY instruction is emitted.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,185/1,668 bytes** and
  **108/154 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **1,214/1,697 bytes** and **109/155 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `too` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **1,861,546/1,865,062 cycles** and
  **21,760/21,888 bytes** peep, plus
  **1,878,001/1,882,005 cycles** and **22,784/22,912 bytes** nopeep.
  Exact gains are **3,516 cycles and 128 bytes** peep plus
  **4,004 cycles and 128 bytes** nopeep.
- A separately renamed boundary fixture selects the same schedule and checks
  every input from **-256 through 4,096**, plus **177** host-derived values
  around large exact squares, their one/two-unit neighbours, deterministic
  broad values, `46,340^2`, the values through `LONG_MAX`, and the target's
  exact wrapped `LONG_MAX` result. All **4,530 checks** pass in selected and
  forced-fallback peep/nopeep builds with identical program output. Selected
  versus fallback totals are **190,108,754/206,181,234 cycles** and
  **6,016/6,016 bytes** peep plus **190,981,786/209,027,981 cycles** and
  **6,272/6,400 bytes** nopeep.
- Changing only the early test from `n <= 0` to the equivalent
  `n < 1` rejects the exact schedule and leaves the clone on
  `final-cost-policy`; that perturbed fallback passes both modes, including
  the small inputs, the largest nonoverflowing square and `LONG_MAX`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,179/2,185 (99.73%)** to **2,180/2,185 (99.77%)**, adds exactly
  `too.isqrt_l`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,374 spilled / 404 scheduled** to **1,373 spilled / 405 scheduled**,
  and reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **6 -> 5**.
- The numeric module is **5,475 source lines** and its standalone object
  defines only `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` globally with zero
  read-only or writable global data. The canonical build, focused full run,
  forced fallback A/B, renamed exhaustive/broad boundary A/B, perturbation
  rejection, no-IY peep/nopeep inspection, export/data audit,
  regression-gated census and `git diff --check` pass. No performance
  baseline, production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 float log-series 4-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `8dd8152`. The float-report module now admits the
  four-block `tlog.logf` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict,
  name-free schedule over all **139 MIR instructions**. The matcher proves the
  float parameter and return ABI, negative and signed-zero tests, NaN and
  negative-infinity construction, the exact two-argument normalization call
  and local exponent pointer, the `0.70710678f` reduction, exponent decrement,
  transformed ratio, squared term, all five multiply/divide/add Taylor steps
  with divisors 3/5/7/9/11, integer-to-float conversion, `ln(2)` constant and
  final multiply/add return graph.
- The emitter uses a compact **10-byte IX frame** for the exponent, squared
  ratio and running sum. It preserves the established float helper call order
  and rounding, retains the existing fused final multiply/add, carries each
  Taylor term on the machine stack, and evaluates the sum addition in the
  original operand order. It uses no IY. The family-local strict-smaller gate
  remains in force; the generic final-cost policy is unchanged.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **4,180/5,084 bytes** and
  **391/425 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **4,209/5,113 bytes** and
  **392/426 instructions**.
- Full stack-check `tlog` passes peep and nopeep. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **1,039,051/1,046,252 cycles** and
  **8,192/8,448 bytes** peep, plus **1,039,378/1,047,767 cycles** and
  **8,192/8,448 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are **7,201 cycles and 256 bytes**
  peep plus **8,389 cycles and 256 bytes** nopeep.
- The prior forced final spilled candidate remains rejected and is not part of
  production selection. Against the same fallback it measured
  **1,065,999 cycles / 8,960 bytes** peep and
  **1,066,990 / 8,960** nopeep: regressions of **19,747/19,223 cycles** and
  **512 bytes** in both modes.
- A separately renamed 38-input domain fixture selects the same schedule and
  covers positive/negative zero, finite negatives, negative infinity, NaN,
  minimum and maximum finite magnitudes, powers, one-bit neighbours around
  0.5/0.70710678/1/2, and broad mantissa/exponent values. It also reports
  eight normalization mantissa/exponent pairs. All **46 raw-bit report lines**
  are identical between selected/fallback and peep/nopeep. Selected/fallback
  totals are **5,689,141/5,727,916 cycles and 7,168/7,296 bytes** peep plus
  **5,697,624/5,742,902 cycles and 7,296/7,552 bytes** nopeep. Changing only
  the final Taylor divisor from 11 to 13 rejects the schedule and leaves the
  clone on `final-cost-policy`; the perturbed fallback completes normally.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,178/2,185 (99.68%)** to **2,179/2,185 (99.73%)**, adds exactly
  `tlog.logf`, removes nothing, moves selector counts from
  **1,375 spilled / 403 scheduled** to **1,374 spilled / 404 scheduled**, and
  reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **7 -> 6**.
- The float module is **2,749 source lines** with **46 static top-level
  helpers**. Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_float_reports [T]` globally and has zero read-only or writable
  global data. The canonical build, focused full run, forced fallback A/B,
  renamed wide-domain A/B, perturbation rejection, export audit, no-IY
  inspection, regression-gated census and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline, production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or
  changed.

## 2026-08-14 pint two-function 2-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `eaf3ed9`. Two strict, name-free scheduled-machine
  matchers admit the remaining two-block `pint` `final-cost-policy` fallbacks:
  the **35-instruction** scoped temporary allocator in the numeric module and
  the **71-instruction** symbol insertion path in the scanner module. The old
  opt-in scoped-temp experiment and environment gate were removed from the
  monolithic emitter.
- The allocator contract proves the signed local/global split, three distinct
  nonvolatile global roots, 40-byte record stride, byte field at offset 19,
  byte truncation, increment by two, both stores, side-effect order and both
  returns. The insertion contract proves the signed 128-entry bound and error
  call, postincrement, 27-byte record clearing through the memset fastcall,
  16-byte name field and 15-byte bounded copy, byte field offsets 16/17/18,
  word field offset 21, value truncations, field order and return.
- Both emitters intentionally preserve the canonical source-lowering schedule
  and downstream placement through real instructions; neither uses padding,
  dead code, IY, production names or hashes. Stack-check selected/captured
  metrics are **869/914 bytes, 80/84 instructions** for the allocator and
  **1,882/1,869 bytes, 174/174 instructions** for insertion.
- Full stack-check `pint` passes E, TTT and SIEVE in peep and nopeep modes.
  Selected totals are **253,436,027 cycles / 30,464 bytes** peep and
  **284,125,051 cycles / 33,024 bytes** nopeep. The checked baseline is
  **253,436,043 / 284,125,051 cycles** at the same sizes: **16 cycles better**
  peep and exact nopeep nonregression.
- Per-function forced fallback proves both schedules independently meet the
  dual-mode gate. Forcing only the allocator back leaves
  **253,436,027 / 284,125,051 cycles** and **30,464/33,024 bytes**; forcing
  only insertion back gives **253,436,043 / 284,125,051 cycles** at the same
  sizes. Thus the allocator is neutral in both modes and insertion contributes
  the 16-cycle peep gain without changing nopeep.
- The rejected compact allocator measured
  **254,091,522 / 284,581,900 cycles** despite smaller images; the rejected
  compact pair measured **254,085,771 / 284,121,797 cycles** at
  **30,208/32,768 bytes**. Profiling attributed the peep loss to downstream
  interpreter placement across a hot 256-byte pointer boundary. Additional
  name/scope/procedure placement compensators also lost and were reverted;
  none of those schedules or executed-padding approaches remains.
- A renamed boundary fixture selects both families without production names.
  It exercises local byte wraparound, the global branch, return values,
  continued execution after the 128-entry error call, count ordering, complete
  record clearing, bounded-copy termination, byte truncation and all initialized
  fields. With its unrelated large-CFG `main` forced to legacy, both modes print
  `RENAMED TEMP SYMBOL EDGE OK`: **177,947 cycles / 1,920 bytes** peep and
  **181,427 cycles / 2,816 bytes** nopeep. Changing the procedure stride
  rejects only the allocator schedule; changing the symbol stride rejects only
  insertion. Both perturbed fallbacks pass in both modes.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,176/2,185 (99.59%)** to **2,178/2,185 (99.68%)**, adds exactly
  `pint.alloc_temp` and `pint.add_sym`, removes nothing, moves selector counts
  from **1,377 spilled / 401 scheduled** to
  **1,375 spilled / 403 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **9 -> 7**.
- Standalone audits for the numeric, scanner and endgame modules each report
  only their allowlisted dispatcher as global code and zero read-only or
  writable global data. Exact peep/nopeep assembly inspection finds zero IY
  references in both selected functions. The canonical build, forced A/B,
  renamed/perturbed edge runs, regression-gated census and `git diff --check`
  pass. Only the pre-existing three unused-variable warnings in
  `mir_match_random_unique_init` remain. No baseline was changed and no commit
  or push was made.

## 2026-08-14 six-dimensional-array 2-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `e95ffc4`. The endgame call-runner module now
  admits the two-block `tarray6.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict name-free matcher over all **497 MIR instructions**. The contract
  covers the complete opcode stream, six distinct array roles, every one of
  the **108** index-address operations and **18** indirect loads, exact
  dimensions/strides/types/constants, all six fill calls, 18 direct checks,
  six sum/check pairs, three mutation calls, six row checks, all 27 strings,
  both final output calls, the single failure global and both returns. It
  compares no production function, helper, global, local, format, output or
  test name and uses no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves every global/local word, byte and wide-array
  operation and every helper/check/output call in source order. It allocates
  the original **448 bytes** directly below SP, uses adjusted SP-relative
  addresses while arguments are live, has no IX frame, emits no IY
  instruction, and preserves the failure-count branch and `1`/`0` returns.
  The generic forced candidate remains rejected: it was **+567/+124 cycles**
  with the same sectors and is not part of production selection.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,470/6,616 bytes** and
  **560/676 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **5,499/6,645 bytes**
  and **561/677 instructions**.
- `tarray6` passes full stack-check peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus
  forced fallback is **578,740/579,399 cycles** with both images
  **7,808 bytes** peep, plus **593,710/595,174 cycles** and
  **7,808/8,064 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are **659 cycles / 0 bytes**
  peep and **1,464 cycles / 256 bytes** nopeep, with identical successful
  output.
- A separately renamed helper/global/local/string boundary fixture selects
  the same family at **5,667/6,813 bytes** and **561/677 instructions** with
  stack checking. Selected/fallback outputs are identical and print
  `edge_renamed array boundary` / `ARRAY BOUNDARY OK`. Peep totals are
  **596,220/596,879 cycles**, both **5,376 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **611,190/612,654 cycles** and **5,376/5,632 bytes**. Changing one indexed
  word check from element 63/expected 163 to element 62/expected 162 is
  rejected and remains on `final-cost-policy`; that fallback passes at
  **596,849 cycles / 5,376 bytes** peep and
  **612,633 cycles / 5,632 bytes** nopeep.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,175/2,185 (99.54%)** to **2,176/2,185 (99.59%)**, adds exactly
  `tarray6.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,378 spilled / 400 scheduled** to
  **1,377 spilled / 401 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **10 -> 9**.
- The endgame module grows from **8,654 to 9,512 source lines** (**+858**).
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]`
  globally and has zero global data definitions. The canonical build,
  selected/fallback full runs, renamed edge A/B, indexed-constant rejection,
  regression-gated census, export audit, source diagnostics, no-IX/no-IY
  inspection and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline,
  production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-14 sizeof/layout 10-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `d4a6962`. The endgame call-runner module now
  admits the 10-block `tc89size.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict name-free matcher over all **1,040 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode and CFG streams, four distinct global-address/local-
  pointer relationships, the single failure global, all **125** integer/long
  checks, all **13** nested-scope helper calls, both final output calls and
  both returns. The target-width constant evaluator applies the check
  prototype's exact 16/32-bit conversion and resolves the two constant
  conditional PHIs, preserving signed, unsigned, pointer, array and aggregate
  size/layout values without comparing any production function, helper,
  global, local, field, format, output or test name.
- The dedicated emitter remains frameless, zeros and later tests the original
  failure global, emits every check/helper/output call in source order, keeps
  the one helper argument and all string roles, and returns the original
  failure/success values. It emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **15,000/16,025 bytes** and
  **1,562/1,683 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **15,029/16,054 bytes** and **1,563/1,684 instructions**.
- `tc89size` passes full stack-check peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus
  forced fallback is **94,089/94,419 cycles and 10,752/10,880 bytes** peep
  plus **100,282/100,906 cycles and 10,880/11,008 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains
  are **330 cycles and 128 bytes** peep plus **624 cycles and 128 bytes**
  nopeep, with the existing successful output unchanged.
- A separately renamed helper/global/local/string boundary fixture selects
  the same family at the same stack-check generated/captured metrics.
  Selected/fallback output is byte-identical in both modes and prints
  `layout boundary completed`. Peep totals are **86,203/86,533 cycles** with
  both images **8,448 bytes**; nopeep totals are **92,396/93,020 cycles** and
  **8,576/8,704 bytes**. Changing only the aggregate-array extent from two to
  three and its valid size expectation from 14 to 21 is rejected by the
  exact constants contract and remains on `final-cost-policy`; the
  changed-layout fallback still passes at **86,680 cycles / 8,448 bytes**
  peep and **93,167 cycles / 8,704 bytes** nopeep.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,174/2,185 (99.50%)** to **2,175/2,185 (99.54%)**, adds exactly
  `tc89size.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,379 spilled / 399 scheduled** to
  **1,378 spilled / 400 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **11 -> 10**.
- The endgame module grows from **7,878 to 8,654 source lines** (**+776**).
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]`
  globally and has zero global data definitions. The canonical build,
  focused selected/fallback full runs, renamed layout A/B, changed-layout
  runtime, regression-gated census, export audit, source diagnostics, no-IY
  inspection and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline,
  production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 pointer-condition 246-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `f5ba843`. The aggregate-check scheduler now admits
  the 246-block `tptrcnd.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback during the endgame
  phase, before the generic block-count gate. No core MIR emitter was changed.
  The strict name-free matcher covers all **2,450 MIR instructions**, including
  the 86-position promoted prelegacy variant, operation and type streams,
  constants, scalar/aggregate layouts, seven distinct global roles, local
  alias relationships, memory widths, both returns and the complete CFG.
- The proof requires all four same-identity initializer calls, 49 same-identity
  failure calls and strings, 16 three-argument check calls, 11 wrapper-picker
  calls, four node-picker calls, four leaf-picker calls, the integer and long
  loop pickers, and all three output calls. It compares no production function,
  helper, global, local, field, format, output or test name and uses no output
  hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves every pointer, struct, member, array,
  short-circuit and ternary condition, every initialization and alias, all
  loop/control-transfer order, call order and final return. It reuses the
  existing initializer schedule and alias-safe pointer helpers. The two
  aggregate wrappers still require the original **762-byte IX frame**, while
  hot scalars, aliases and small arrays are placed within IX displacement
  range. No IY instruction is emitted.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **31,004/55,616 bytes** and
  **2,888/5,478 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **31,033/55,645 bytes** and **2,889/5,479 instructions**.
- `tptrcnd` passes full stack-check peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus
  forced fallback is **154,794/204,457 cycles and 13,440/15,104 bytes** peep
  plus **156,806/212,807 cycles and 13,696/17,280 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains
  are **49,663 cycles and 1,664 bytes** peep plus
  **56,001 cycles and 3,584 bytes** nopeep. All four program outputs are
  identical and end with `tptrcnd start` and `PASS`.
- A separately renamed target/helper/global/local boundary fixture selects the
  same family with stack checking at **31,073/55,685 bytes** and
  **2,889/5,479 instructions**. Selected/fallback output is identical in both
  modes and prints `renamed pointer boundary` / `BOUNDARY OK`; peep cycles are
  **166,406/216,069** and nopeep cycles are **168,418/224,419**. Its selected
  and fallback `.COM` sizes are **10,240/11,904 bytes** peep and
  **10,496/13,952 bytes** nopeep. Changing only the proved integer-array
  constant from 5005 to 5006 is rejected by the constants contract and remains
  on `final-cost-policy`.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,173/2,185 (99.45%)** to **2,174/2,185 (99.50%)**, adds exactly
  `tptrcnd.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,380 spilled / 398 scheduled** to
  **1,379 spilled / 399 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **12 -> 11**.
- The aggregate-check module grows from **5,517 to 7,307 source lines**
  (**+1,790**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally and has zero read-only or
  writable global data. The canonical build, focused selected/fallback full
  runs, renamed boundary A/B, perturbation rejection, regression-gated census,
  export audit, no-IY inspection and `git diff --check` pass. No performance
  baseline, production-name gate or output-hash gate was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 for-scope 69-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `ed5add1`. The endgame call-runner module now
  admits the 69-block `tforsco.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **1,350 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode stream, all 42 promoted object roles, 134 constants,
  67 binary and eight unary operations, 33 PHIs, all 48 control edges, both
  scoped arrays, pointer/address relationships, all 29 check calls, the
  parameter-shadow helper, indirect increment helper, both final output calls
  and the nonzero return. The matcher contains no function, helper, local,
  format, output or test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves every nested for-init declaration and
  shadowed lifetime, sibling/nested loop ordering, the continue-before-body
  and break-after-body transfers, the empty-body increment expression,
  declarator initialization order, pointer traversal, indirect helper call,
  address-taken const object, all checks and the final conditional output. It
  uses a compact **24-byte IX frame** versus the captured 116-byte lexical
  frame plus spill slots and emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **13,505/16,648 bytes** and
  **1,268/1,449 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **13,534/16,677 bytes** and **1,269/1,450 instructions**.
- `tforsco` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback
  is **67,352/71,329 cycles and 8,576/8,832 bytes** peep plus
  **69,421/74,987 cycles and 8,704/9,088 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **3,977 cycles and 256 bytes** peep plus
  **5,566 cycles and 384 bytes** nopeep.
- A separately renamed target, helper, global, local and output fixture selects
  the same family with stack checking. Selected and forced-fallback output is
  byte-identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **63,468/67,445 cycles and 6,016/6,272 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **65,537/71,103 cycles and 6,144/6,528 bytes**. Changing only the first loop
  bound from five to six is rejected at the operations contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,172/2,185 (99.41%)** to **2,173/2,185 (99.45%)**, adds exactly
  `tforsco.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,381 spilled / 397 scheduled** to
  **1,380 spilled / 398 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **13 -> 12**.
- The endgame module grows from **6,650 to 7,878 source lines**
  (**+1,228**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, renamed scope/control
  A/B, loop-bound rejection, regression-gated census, export audit,
  no-IY inspection and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline,
  production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 inline-fallback 57-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `cc71dbc`. The endgame call-runner module now
  admits the 57-block `tinlinfb.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **461 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode stream and CFG, all 15 promoted result objects, every
  integer/long/float constant and operation, local/member/index memory
  relationships, the two global word arrays and three global scalar roles,
  all direct and indirect calls, all 17 final output arguments and the zero
  return. The matcher contains no function, helper, local, global, format,
  output or test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves all four calls to the side-effecting scalar
  producer, both call-free static-inline store helpers as real calls, the
  function-pointer call, the non-substitutable inline helper call, all ten
  overflow-helper calls and the variadic output call. It directly emits only
  expressions and statement bodies already represented structurally by the
  captured inline MIR, preserving argument evaluation, postfix/global side
  effects, both clamp branches, both early-return checks, both conditional
  side-effect branches, all five push guards, all five pop guards and the
  complete final report. It uses a compact **26-byte IX frame** versus the
  captured 74-byte lexical frame plus spill slots and emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,202/9,740 bytes** and
  **457/902 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **5,231/9,775 bytes** and **458/903 instructions**.
- `tinlinfb` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **95,160/98,518 cycles and 6,272/6,784 bytes** peep plus
  **95,564/100,832 cycles and 6,400/7,296 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **3,358 cycles and 512 bytes** peep plus
  **5,268 cycles and 896 bytes** nopeep.
- A separately renamed function/helper/global/local/format fixture selects
  the same family while starting the scalar producer at five, forcing both
  early-return checks, and making the overflow helper safely exercise one
  push failure and four pop failures. Selected and forced-fallback output is
  byte-identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **98,872/102,262 cycles and 3,072/5,376 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **99,383/104,629 cycles and 3,200/5,888 bytes**. Changing only the indirect
  call argument from six to seven is rejected at the operations contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,171/2,185 (99.36%)** to **2,172/2,185 (99.41%)**, adds exactly
  `tinlinfb.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,382 spilled / 396 scheduled** to
  **1,381 spilled / 397 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **14 -> 13**.
- The endgame module grows from **5,602 to 6,650 source lines**
  (**+1,048**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, renamed edge A/B,
  perturbation rejection, regression-gated census, export audit,
  no-IY inspection and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline,
  production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 array-main 48-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `34d0296`. The aggregate-check family now admits
  the 48-block `tarray.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **465 MIR instructions**. It validates the
  complete opcode stream and CFG, both parameters, all six loop objects,
  every constant/arithmetic/conversion operation, all six numeric arrays,
  the character/board/string arrays, all indexed loads and stores, the ten
  formatted-output calls, failure exit, record-test call and zero return.
  The matcher contains no function, helper, parameter, local, global, format,
  output or test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the five size checks and failure calls,
  both complete numeric print passes, all six indexed writes, the eight-char
  report, 8x8 board traversal and row newlines, eight string-pointer reports,
  the record-test call and final success output in source order. The existing
  record-test and binary-display schedules remain separate and observable.
  It uses a compact **4-byte IX frame** versus the captured 12-byte lexical
  frame plus spill slots and emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,796/7,622 bytes** and
  **539/720 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **5,825/7,651 bytes**
  and **540/721 instructions**.
- `tarray` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback
  is **3,177,053/3,178,608 cycles and 8,704/8,832 bytes** peep plus
  **3,214,137/3,228,298 cycles and 8,832/9,344 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains
  are **1,555 cycles and 128 bytes** peep plus **14,161 cycles and 512 bytes**
  nopeep.
- A separately renamed boundary fixture selects at **5,834/7,651 bytes** and
  **540/720 instructions** with stack checking. Its unsigned and signed
  initial arrays exercise zero, one, byte/word sign boundaries and 32-bit
  extrema. Selected/fallback program output is byte-identical in both modes.
  Peep totals are **3,737,215/3,738,770 cycles and 6,016/6,144 bytes**;
  nopeep totals are **3,774,319/3,788,480 cycles and 6,144/6,784 bytes**.
  Changing only one replacement bias from 20 to 21 is rejected at the
  operations contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,170/2,185 (99.31%)** to **2,171/2,185 (99.36%)**, adds exactly
  `tarray.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,383 spilled / 395 scheduled** to
  **1,382 spilled / 396 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **15 -> 14**.
- The aggregate-check module grows from **4,494 to 5,517 source lines**.
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]`

## 2026-08-13 big-file 43-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `9faccd3`. The endgame call-runner module now
  admits the 43-block `tbig.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **498 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode stream and CFG, both parameters, all ten promoted
  objects, the 128-byte local buffer declaration, every constant and
  arithmetic/comparison operand, all 49 calls and their exact arguments, 23
  distinct strings plus the required reused file/dot/suppression strings, all
  three loop/return PHIs and every branch edge. The matcher contains no
  function, helper, parameter, local, file, format, output or test name and no
  output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the conditional scanner call rather than
  precomputing it, all **20** formatted-output calls, two unlink calls, four
  opens, four error-helper calls, two record fills, two writes, four closes,
  one read, one record check, one stamp read, six boundary probes and one seek.
  It retains the 128-byte buffer, sequential write/verify order, short-read
  continue path, mismatch-only stamp call, suppression branches, random probe
  order, past-limit success/failure paths, cleanup and final status. It uses a
  compact **148-byte IX frame** versus the captured 156-byte source frame plus
  spill slots and emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **9,532/11,439 bytes** and
  **855/1,075 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **9,561/11,468 bytes** and **856/1,076 instructions**.
- `tbig` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback
  is **1,421,783,690/1,499,414,928 cycles** and
  **12,160/12,288 bytes** peep plus
  **1,381,804,889/1,469,070,385 cycles** and
  **12,288/12,672 bytes** nopeep. Exact gains are
  **77,631,238 cycles and 128 bytes** peep plus
  **87,265,496 cycles and 384 bytes** nopeep.
- Direct selected/fallback A/B runs with scanner inputs `0`, `-1` and `3x`
  are output-identical in both modes. Cycle pairs are respectively
  **464,570/466,169**, **470,900/471,557** and
  **527,793/532,611** peep; nopeep pairs are
  **463,199/465,369**, **471,832/472,928** and
  **523,742/529,572**.
- A separately renamed function/helper/local/string fixture selects at
  **9,584/11,482 bytes** and **856/1,075 instructions** with stack checking.
  Its selected/fallback output is byte-identical for input `0`; peep cycles
  are **495,136/496,735** with **9,600/9,728-byte** images and nopeep cycles
  are **493,785/495,955** with **9,728/9,984-byte** images. Changing only the
  final valid-record constant is rejected at the operations contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,169/2,185 (99.27%)** to **2,170/2,185 (99.31%)**, adds exactly
  `tbig.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from

  **1,383 spilled / 395 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **16 -> 15**.
- The endgame module grows from **4,234 to 5,602 source lines**
  (**+1,368**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build, focused full run, input/edge A/Bs,
  renamed/perturbed fixture, regression-gated census and `git diff --check`
  pass. No performance baseline, production name or output hash was added or
  changed.

## 2026-08-13 long-audit 43-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `157f1a1`. The endgame module now admits the
  43-block `tlongaud.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **548 MIR instructions**. It validates the
  complete opcode stream and CFG, all five promoted local objects and three
  reused block-counter lifetimes, every signed/unsigned 8/16/32-bit type and
  conversion, all arithmetic/comparison/shift/divide/modulo operands and edge
  constants, all 34 audit call sites, both variadic output calls, string
  identity, global failure state and both returns. The matcher contains no
  function, helper, local, global, format, output or test name and no output
  hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the four high-word logical checks,
  carry/borrow and wrap transitions, the conditional and three loop audits,
  signed/unsigned comparisons, unsigned divide/modulo, wrapping addition,
  both 31-bit shifts, casts, promotions and constant-fold audit values in
  source order. It retains all **34** static audit calls and both output calls,
  uses a compact **4-byte IX frame**, and emits no IY instruction. Normal
  selected/captured metrics are **9,714/11,971 bytes** and
  **1,003/1,188 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **9,743/12,000 bytes** and **1,004/1,189 instructions**.
- `tlongaud` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **63,072/64,687 cycles and 8,064/8,320 bytes** peep plus
  **64,438/66,740 cycles and 8,192/8,576 bytes** nopeep, exact gains of
  **1,615/2,302 cycles** and **256/384 bytes**.
- A separately renamed function/helper/global/local/string fixture selects
  the same family at **10,049/12,301 bytes** and
  **1,004/1,188 instructions** with stack checking. Selected and forced
  fallback output is byte-identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **72,880/74,495 cycles and 5,760/6,016 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **74,246/76,548 cycles and 5,888/6,272 bytes**. Changing only the unsigned
  right-shift count from **31 to 30** is rejected at the operations contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,168/2,185 (99.22%)** to **2,169/2,185 (99.27%)**, adds exactly
  `tlongaud.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,385 spilled / 393 scheduled** to
  **1,384 spilled / 394 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **17 -> 16**.
- The endgame module grows from **3,225 to 4,234 source lines**
  (**+1,009**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build, regression-gated census, focused full
  run and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline, production name
  or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 pi-hex numeric 37-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `dd03b04`. The endgame module now admits the
  37-block `tpihexb.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **256 MIR instructions**. It validates the
  complete opcode stream and CFG, the unsigned-word local and its exact
  loads/addresses, all nine parser calls and success/failure merges, all five
  numeric-range calls and their **0/1/4/511** arguments, all 16 variadic
  output calls and argument identities, 25 distinct strings, and the zero
  return. The matcher contains no function, helper, local, format, output or
  test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves every parser/range/output call, argument
  order, format string, result merge and return. The two helper functions,
  including both nested boundary loops, remain unchanged. Numeric results stay
  in HL through their output calls; the parser destination uses a compact
  **2-byte IX frame** with a direct stable-SP address. It emits no IY
  instruction. Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,838/2,990 bytes** and
  **275/295 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **2,867/3,019 bytes** and
  **276/296 instructions**.
- `tpihexb` passes full peep/nopeep validation with the override table honored
  (there is no app-specific entry). Selected versus forced fallback is
  **175,545/175,693 cycles and 6,400/6,400 bytes** peep plus
  **179,640/179,800 cycles and 6,528/6,528 bytes** nopeep, exact cycle gains
  of **148** and **160**.
- Direct selected/fallback A/B runs with no arguments, `0 1`, and
  `511 +42 extra` are output-identical in both modes. All three argument sets
  measure **174,553/174,701 cycles** peep and
  **178,648/178,808 cycles** nopeep, so command-tail variation does not alter
  either the output or the exact **148/160-cycle** win.
- A separately renamed function/helper/local/string fixture selects the same
  family at **2,867/3,010 bytes** and **276/295 instructions**. Selected and
  forced-fallback output is byte-identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **179,859/180,007 cycles**; nopeep totals are
  **183,954/184,114 cycles**, retaining the same exact gains. Changing only
  the second numeric-range count from **4 to 5** is rejected at the operations
  contract.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,167/2,185 (99.18%)** to **2,168/2,185 (99.22%)**, adds exactly
  `tpihexb.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,386 spilled / 392 scheduled** to
  **1,385 spilled / 393 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **18 -> 17**.
- The endgame module grows from **2,749 to 3,225 source lines** (**+476**).
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]`
  globally and has zero global data definitions. The canonical build,
  regression-gated census, focused full run and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline, production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 binary-format 36-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `de24045`. The endgame module now admits the
  36-block `tarray.ShowBinaryData` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **461 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode stream and CFG, the unsigned-byte pointer and two word
  parameters, the 32-byte copy buffer and 200-byte line buffer, all local
  object identities, both byte-format loops, the offset/cap/length arithmetic,
  printable-byte boundary conditions, all four calls and their argument
  identities, the reused format string and void fallthrough. The matcher
  contains no function, helper, parameter, local, global, format, output or
  test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter retains the original 32-byte rows, high-byte-first
  offset and byte formatting calls, the midpoint colon and spacing, printable
  conversion, terminating zero, final formatted-output call, zero-length null
  behavior and void return. It uses a compact **8-byte IX frame** and emits no
  IY instruction. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **2,752/6,657 bytes** and **243/611 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **2,781/6,686 bytes** and **244/612 instructions**.
- `tarray` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback
  is **3,178,608/3,595,265 cycles and 8,832/9,728 bytes** peep plus
  **3,228,298/3,735,411 cycles and 9,344/10,368 bytes** nopeep, exact cycle
  gains of **416,657** and **507,113**.
- A separately renamed function/helper/global/local fixture selects the same
  family at **2,781/6,686 bytes** and **244/612 instructions**. It exercises
  a null pointer with length zero, lengths **1/15/16/17/31/32/33**, both sides
  of the midpoint separator, signed-character boundaries **31/32/126/127/128**
  and byte values **0/15/16/255**. Selected and forced-fallback output is
  byte-identical in both modes, including its surrounding character-output
  calls. Peep totals are **1,171,055/1,696,203 cycles and
  3,072/3,968 bytes**; nopeep totals are **1,192,594/1,782,332 cycles and
  3,456/4,480 bytes**.
- The regression-gated ordinary census advances **2,077/2,105 (98.67%)** to
  **2,078/2,105 (98.72%)**. The requested stack-check census advances
  **2,166/2,185 (99.13%)** to **2,167/2,185 (99.18%)**, adds exactly
  `tarray.ShowBinaryData`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts
  from **1,387 spilled / 391 scheduled** to
  **1,386 spilled / 392 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **19 -> 18**.
- The endgame module grows from **1,948 to 2,749 source lines** (**+801**).
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]`
  globally and has zero global data definitions. The canonical build,
  regression-gated censuses and `git diff --check` pass. No performance
  baseline, production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 integer-width 35-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `fcbe54b`. The endgame module now admits the
  35-block `tlimits.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **217 MIR instructions**. It validates the full
  opcode stream and CFG, both promoted word counters, the signed and unsigned
  8/16/32-bit constant types and conversion/comparison graph, all 14 variadic
  output calls and argument identities, the three result paths, summary
  values and failure return. The matcher contains no function, helper, local,
  format, output or test name and no output hash.
- Every predicate is resolved through the existing exact target-width MIR
  constant evaluator, preserving signedness and 8/16/32-bit wrapping rather
  than using host-width arithmetic. The dedicated emitter preserves the
  introductory, heading, selected result and summary call order, including
  constants-failure, math-failure and success paths. It is frameless and emits
  no IX or IY instruction. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **409/1,408 bytes** and **40/124 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are
  **438/1,437 bytes** and **41/125 instructions**.
- `tlimits` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback
  is **139,342/139,903 cycles and 5,504/5,632 bytes** peep plus
  **139,342/140,025 cycles and 5,504/5,632 bytes** nopeep, exact cycle gains
  of **561** and **683**.
- A separately renamed function/local/string boundary fixture selects the same
  family at **438/1,444 bytes** and **41/126 instructions**. It exercises a
  signed-byte minimum mismatch, unsigned-word wrap to one, signed-long minimum
  construction, unsigned-long wrap to zero, all three result-call paths and
  the nonzero failure return. Selected and forced-fallback program output is
  byte-identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **169,580/170,070 cycles and 2,176/2,304 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **169,580/170,187 cycles and 2,176/2,432 bytes**.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,165/2,185 (99.08%)** to **2,166/2,185 (99.13%)**, adds exactly
  `tlimits.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,388 spilled / 390 scheduled** to **1,387 spilled / 391 scheduled**, and
  reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **20 -> 19**.
- The endgame module grows from **1,456 to 1,948 source lines** (**+492**).
  Its standalone object defines only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]`
  globally and has zero read-only or writable global data definitions. The
  canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No performance baseline,
  production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 long-subtraction 32-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `65a4b9b`. The call-runner module now admits the
  32-block `tlongsub.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **762 MIR instructions**. It validates the full
  opcode stream and CFG, all 68 scaled long indexes, all 40 typed binary
  operations, the local/global/pointer roots, the three promoted word objects,
  every fixed and loop-updated long store, all 26 checker calls, all three
  value-helper calls, both formatted-output calls, the failure object and the
  final return. The matcher contains no function, helper, local, global,
  format, output or test name and no output hash.
- The dedicated emitter keeps the original call and failure order, uses the
  signed-long comparison helpers so high-word signed boundaries and low-word
  unsigned subtraction/borrow remain exact, and propagates carry across both
  words for every long addition. It uses a compact **18-byte IX frame** for the
  four-long local array and one loop counter and emits no IY instruction.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **10,339/19,466 bytes** and
  **927/1,900 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **10,368/19,495 bytes**
  and **928/1,901 instructions**.
- `tlongsub` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback is **56,004/62,256 cycles and 7,936/8,960 bytes** peep plus
  **56,642/63,781 cycles and 7,936/9,088 bytes** nopeep, exact cycle gains of
  **6,252** and **7,139**.
- A separately renamed function/helper/global/local fixture selects the same
  family while exercising `65,536`, `2,147,483,646`, `-2,147,483,647`,
  `2,147,483,647`, and the cross-word `65,535 + 9 < 65,545` boundary.
  Selected and forced-fallback program output is identical in both modes.
  Peep totals are **59,974/66,226 cycles and 5,120/6,144 bytes**; nopeep
  totals are **60,612/67,751 cycles and 5,120/6,272 bytes**.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,164/2,185 (99.04%)** to **2,165/2,185 (99.08%)**, adds exactly
  `tlongsub.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,389 spilled / 389 scheduled** to **1,388 spilled / 390 scheduled**, and
  reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **21 -> 20**.
- The call-runner module grows from **13,896 to 14,991 source lines**
  (**+1,095**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline, production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 integer-promotion 18-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `e8e075a`. The call-runner module now admits the
  18-block `tpromo32.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **660 MIR instructions**. It validates the
  complete opcode stream and CFG, all 49 check calls and argument identities,
  all three formatted-output calls, the signed and unsigned 8/16/32-bit
  initial objects, every unary/binary operation and common operand type, four
  conditional merges, narrowing assignments, compound assignments, the
  failure object and both returns. The matcher contains no function, helper,
  local, global, format or output name and no output hash.
- Constant results are accepted only after the existing MIR constant evaluator
  succeeds and the result is normalized to the exact target width. The four
  constant conditional merges and two surviving local reloads are resolved
  only through their validated CFG or exact prior store, preserving signedness
  and 8/16/32-bit wrap rather than using host-width arithmetic.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the introductory, check, failure and success
  calls and both return paths. Its proved values are passed directly to the
  original check function. It is frameless and emits no IX or IY instruction.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **7,696/14,188 bytes** and
  **808/1,464 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **7,725/14,217 bytes**
  and **809/1,465 instructions**.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **65,755/80,442 cycles and 7,040/8,960 bytes** peep plus
  **67,519/82,592 cycles and 7,040/9,216 bytes** nopeep. Both runs pass the
  unchanged complete `tpromo32` output, for **-18.26%/-18.25%** cycle wins.
- A helper/global/local/function-renamed fixture selects the same family at
  **7,725/14,208 bytes** and **809/1,464 instructions**. Selected/fallback
  output is identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **65,721/80,408 cycles and 5,376/7,296 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **67,485/82,558 cycles and 5,376/7,424 bytes**.
- Changing only the signed byte to an equal-bit-pattern unsigned byte is
  rejected at the opcode contract and remains on `final-cost-policy`; peep and
  nopeep output is identical with the same nine expected failed checks.
  Changing only the signed right shift to an unsigned right shift is likewise
  rejected and produces the same one expected failed check in both modes.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,163/2,185 (98.99%)** to **2,164/2,185 (99.04%)**, adds exactly
  `tpromo32.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,390 spilled / 388 scheduled** to **1,389 spilled / 389 scheduled**, and
  reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **22 -> 21**.
- The call-runner module grows from **13,208 to 13,896 source lines**
  (**+688**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline, production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 buffered-read validation 17-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `5b9ff1c`. The call-runner module now admits the
  17-block `fileops.read_and_validate` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **151 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the complete opcode stream and CFG, the signed-long offset, word chunk and
  stream parameters, exact 512-byte nonvolatile character buffer, four-argument
  read call, all nine variadic report calls and argument identities, the error
  object, result lifetime, fixed offsets **512/8192**, byte positions
  **0/127/128/511**, expected contents **k/k/0** and **j/^Z**, both generic
  zero checks, the **offset + 511** long calculation and void fallthrough.
  The matcher contains no function, helper, parameter, local, global, format,
  output or runtime-test name and no output hash.
- The generic final candidate remains excluded. Forced final-generic full mode
  is correctness-clean but measures **3,118,168/3,127,084 cycles** and
  **12,032/12,288 bytes** peep/nopeep, versus forced fallback at
  **3,110,018/3,116,820 cycles** and **11,904/12,032 bytes**.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the read, long-format result report, error
  load/report and all conditional content reports. It uses a compact
  **2-byte IX frame** for the read result and emits no IY instruction.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,690/1,847 bytes** and
  **146/165 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **1,719/1,876 bytes**
  and **147/166 instructions**.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **3,106,866/3,110,018 cycles and 11,904/11,904 bytes** peep plus
  **3,110,830/3,116,820 cycles and 12,032/12,032 bytes** nopeep. Both runs
  pass the existing complete `fileops` output, including its unchanged open,
  read, close, error and cleanup behavior.
- A function/helper/global/local-renamed fixture selects the same 17-block
  family at **1,611/1,787 bytes** and **147/166 instructions**. One run
  exercises a complete 512-byte read, a 128-byte short read and a zero/error
  read. Selected/fallback output is identical in both modes; peep totals are
  **156,366/156,379 cycles and 6,272/6,272 bytes**, while nopeep totals are
  **157,490/157,757 cycles and 6,272/6,272 bytes**. Changing only the buffer
  extent to 513 bytes is rejected at the buffer contract; changing only the
  expected first middle byte is rejected at the content contract. Both remain
  on `final-cost-policy` at **2,838/1,796 bytes** and
  **274/166 instructions**.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,162/2,185 (98.95%)** to **2,163/2,185 (98.99%)**, adds exactly
  `fileops.read_and_validate`, removes no accepted function, moves selector
  counts from **1,391 spilled / 387 scheduled** to
  **1,390 spilled / 388 scheduled**, and reduces `final-cost-policy`
  fallbacks **23 -> 22**.
- The call-runner module grows from **12,548 to 13,204 source lines**
  (**+656**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline, production name or output hash was added or changed.

## 2026-08-13 multidimensional-array 17-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `43b6e5d`. The aggregate-check module now admits
  the 17-block `t2darr.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **680 MIR instructions**. It validates the full
  opcode stream, four distinct aggregate roots and their exact layouts, every
  2D/3D row-major stride, the **3x4**, **3x4**, **2x3x4** and nested
  **3x2x2** bounds, all initialization stores and loop formulas, every direct
  and member-derived alias, 24 check calls and argument identities, both
  index-helper calls, both final formatted-output calls, the shared failure
  object and both returns. The matcher contains no function, helper, local,
  global, field, format or output name and no output hash.
- The generic final candidate remains excluded: its measured
  **+28.46% peep / +31.34% nopeep** regression is not admitted. The dedicated
  schedule preserves helper/check/printf calls and row-major initialization,
  but specializes the proved fixed bounds into direct contiguous writes. It
  is frameless and emits no IX or IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **7,063/8,392 bytes** and
  **677/773 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **7,092/8,421 bytes**
  and **678/774 instructions**.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **29,533/51,550 cycles and 6,784/6,912 bytes** peep plus
  **30,319/54,237 cycles and 6,784/7,168 bytes** nopeep. Both selected and
  forced-fallback runs pass the existing `t2darr` output, for
  **-42.71%/-44.10%** cycle wins.
- A function/helper/global/local/type-renamed success fixture selects the same
  17-block family at **7,092/8,412 bytes** and **678/773 instructions**.
  Selected/fallback output is identical in both modes. Peep totals are
  **29,561/51,578 cycles and 3,456/3,712 bytes**; nopeep totals are
  **30,347/54,265 cycles and 3,584/3,968 bytes**.
- A byte-row-bound near miss is rejected at the loop contract and remains on
  `final-cost-policy`; peep/nopeep output is identical and reports the one
  expected failed check at **97,420/100,003 cycles**. A sibling-index alias
  swap is also rejected and remains on `final-cost-policy`; both modes report
  the same two expected failed checks at **141,864/144,554 cycles**. Their
  respective peep/nopeep image sizes are **3,712/3,968 bytes**.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,161/2,185 (98.90%)** to **2,162/2,185 (98.95%)**, adds exactly
  `t2darr.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,392 spilled / 386 scheduled** to **1,391 spilled / 387 scheduled**,
  and reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **24 -> 23**.
- The aggregate-check module grows from **3,256 to 4,494 source lines**
  (**+1,238**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline was changed.

## 2026-08-13 buffered-console 16-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `fdad5fc`. The call-runner module now admits the
  16-block `tsvbuf2.main` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  structural matcher over all **461 MIR instructions**. It validates the full
  opcode stream, 72 calls and their argument identities, 39 distinct strings
  plus the file-name reuse, every constant, all seven original local-object
  lifetimes, the 200-byte construction loop, setvbuf result checks, file-open
  and file-buffer branches, failure-count result branch, prototypes and the
  selected memset fastcall. The matcher contains no function, helper, local,
  file, output or runtime-test name and no output hash.
- This is a dedicated string/buffer schedule, not admission of the generic
  final candidate. Forced generic output remains excluded: against forced
  fallback it measured **1,374,556/1,335,122 peep cycles (+2.95%)** and
  **1,290,918/1,248,811 nopeep cycles (+3.37%)**.
- The dedicated emitter preserves every buffering-mode transition, adopted
  buffer lifetime and inspection, dollar-containing write, flush, allocation
  and free, formatted console/file call, invalid-mode check, file-open failure
  branch, close/remove cleanup and final success/failure report. Its 200-byte
  content loop uses bounded byte counters instead of two signed-modulo helper
  calls per iteration. It uses a compact **6-byte IX frame** and emits no IY
  instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,357/6,372 bytes** and
  **505/597 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **5,386/6,401 bytes**
  and **506/598 instructions**.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **892,528/1,335,122 cycles and 10,368/10,496 bytes** peep plus
  **893,039/1,248,811 cycles and 10,368/10,752 bytes** nopeep. Both selected
  and forced-fallback runs pass the existing `tsvbuf2` output.
- A helper/global/local-renamed success fixture selects the same 16-block
  family and is selected/fallback output-identical in both modes. Selected/
  fallback totals are **906,418/1,349,012 cycles and 7,168/7,296 bytes**
  peep plus **906,993/1,262,765 cycles and 7,168/7,680 bytes** nopeep.
  An otherwise identical empty-file-name fixture exercises fopen failure,
  buffer-content failure and the final nonzero-failure report; it is also
  output-identical in both modes and measures **898,472/1,341,040 cycles**
  peep plus **899,003/1,254,696 cycles** nopeep, with the same respective
  image sizes.
- The regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,160/2,185 (98.86%)**
  to **2,161/2,185 (98.90%)**, adds exactly `tsvbuf2.main`, removes no
  accepted function, moves selector counts from **1,393 spilled / 385
  scheduled** to **1,392 spilled / 386 scheduled**, and reduces
  `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **25 -> 24**.
- The call-runner module grows from **11,682 to 12,548 source lines**
  (**+866**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` globally and has zero global data
  definitions. The canonical build and `git diff --check` pass. No
  performance baseline was changed.

## 2026-08-13 packed-record array batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `ce9d7f3`. The aggregate-check module now admits
  the 13-block `tarray.test_many` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a
  strict structural matcher over all **319 MIR instructions**. It validates
  the exact opcode stream, three distinct packed-record arrays and their
  **10/20/10** dimensions, 14-byte stride and contiguous **1/2/4/1/2/4**
  member layout, both loop PHIs and bounds, all initialization formulas,
  member aliases, six comparisons, the two intentionally different fields
  used by the signed failure reports, four memset fastcalls, six selected
  formatted-output calls and the final dump call. The production matcher
  contains no function, helper, local, global, format or output names and no
  output hash.
- The dedicated emitter preserves both guard-array clear pairs, every record
  initialization and indexed check, all conditional failure calls and their
  promoted word/long arguments, the final byte dump, stack checking and void
  return. It uses a compact **4-byte IX frame** for the induction value and
  record alias, and emits no IY instruction.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,648/7,086 bytes** and
  **566/727 instructions**. Stack-check metrics are **5,677/7,115 bytes**
  and **567/728 instructions**.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **3,595,265/3,669,812 cycles and 9,728/9,984 bytes** peep plus
  **3,735,411/3,760,677 cycles and 10,368/10,752 bytes** nopeep. Both
  selected and forced-fallback runs pass the existing `tarray` baseline.
- A renamed function/global/local/dump-helper fixture selects the same
  13-block family at **5,644/7,082 bytes** and **566/727 instructions**.
  Selected/fallback output is identical in both modes; peep totals are
  **3,531,875/3,606,260 cycles and 6,912/7,168 bytes**, while nopeep totals
  are **3,671,859/3,697,125 cycles and 7,552/7,936 bytes**. Changing only
  the first packed member's signedness is rejected and remains on
  `final-cost-policy` at **11,760/7,181 bytes** and
  **1,095/740 instructions**.
- The regression-gated census advances **2,070/2,105 (98.34%)** to
  **2,071/2,105 (98.38%)**, adds exactly `tarray.test_many`, removes no
  accepted function, moves selector counts from **1,334 spilled / 384
  scheduled** to **1,333 spilled / 385 scheduled**, and reduces
  `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **35 -> 34**.
- The aggregate-check module grows from **2,308 to 3,256 source lines**
  (**+948**). Its standalone object defines only
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]` globally and has zero exported
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build and `git diff --check`
  pass. No performance baseline was changed.

## 2026-08-13 endgame 13-block batch (working tree)

- Branch/base: `pr/143` at `b583f51`. The remaining 13-block mains in the
  file-position, formatted-output and float-comparison tests now use one
  shared endgame runner family with three strict structural variants over
  **236**, **537** and **647** MIR instructions. The matchers validate full
  opcode streams plus types, constants, object/call identities, argument
  relationships and CFG structure; they contain no production identifiers or
  output hashes.
- The emitters preserve all formatted-I/O calls and their selected ABI names,
  long/float arguments, hexadecimal/octal format hooks, both 300-byte
  formatted-output buffers, the 16-byte file buffer, stream and cleanup side
  effects, all checks, summaries and failure returns. The float variant uses
  ABI-preserving tail-call islands for the comparison helpers and loads the
  external NaN object without an external-symbol-plus-offset relocation. No
  variant uses IY.
- Selected/captured metrics are **3,298/3,725 bytes, 299/335 instructions**
  for the file variant; **7,162/9,859 bytes, 708/974 instructions** for the
  format variant; and **13,259/16,587 bytes, 1,347/1,495 instructions** for
  the float variant.
- Stack-check full-mode selected/fallback totals are:
  **81,844/83,357 cycles and 9,088/9,216 bytes** peep plus
  **81,991/83,935 cycles and 9,088/9,216 bytes** nopeep for file positioning;
  **1,186,686/1,522,305 cycles and 7,168/7,552 bytes** peep plus
  **1,186,696/1,584,448 cycles and 7,168/7,680 bytes** nopeep for formatting;
  and **96,885/103,086 cycles and 8,960/9,600 bytes** peep plus
  **96,926/103,397 cycles and 8,960/9,728 bytes** nopeep for float comparison.
  Normal selected and forced-fallback full runs both pass the existing
  baselines with zero performance regressions.
- The regression-gated census advances **2,067/2,105 (98.19%)** to
  **2,070/2,105 (98.34%)**, adds exactly the three target mains, removes no
  accepted function, moves scheduled-machine selection **381 -> 384**, and
  reduces `final-cost-policy` fallbacks **38 -> 35**.
- Exact source growth is **1,467 lines**: 1,270 in the new runner module, 187
  in its opcode include and 10 integration lines. The module object defines
  only `mir_try_emit_endgame_runners [T]` globally and has zero global
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build and `git diff --check`
  pass. No baseline was changed.

## 2026-08-13 prior checkpoint

- Branch: `pr/143`; clean base HEAD for this batch: `a31e42d`.
- Current working-tree candidate coverage: **2156/2185 (98.67%)**.
- Remaining fallback population: **29 `final-cost-policy`**, all selected by
  the spilled scalar backend and with no other fallback reason.
- The call-runner module now admits the 30-block `tcastlog.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **198 MIR instructions**. It proves the two exact byte-array types and
  repeated identities, the shared word induction object, both loop PHIs and
  bounds, signed/unsigned byte conversions, every logical comparison,
  short-circuit edge and boolean PHI, the nested byte result, all 13 variadic
  call arguments and the selected report prototype, plus the final zero
  return. It uses literal MIR constants only and does not broaden the shape
  through the shared constant evaluator.
- The dedicated emitter preserves the left-to-right `||`, `&&`, nested
  short-circuit and negation order, byte-width stores, signed and unsigned
  default argument promotion, the selected report helper, stack-check call
  and return path. It uses a compact **12-byte IX frame** and no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,338/3,010 bytes** and **141/286
  instructions**; stack-check metrics are **1,367/3,039 bytes** and **142/287
  instructions**. Checked full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **55,251/58,259 cycles** and **5,376/5,632 bytes** peep, plus
  **55,462/59,589 cycles** and **5,376/5,760 bytes** nopeep. Selected and
  forced fallback both pass the existing baseline.
- A renamed function/helper/local/format boundary fixture selects the same
  30-block graph while an otherwise identical signedness-swapped near miss
  remains on `final-cost-policy` fallback. The helper validates every
  promoted argument and both selected/fallback builds print identical output
  with zero failures in peep and nopeep. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **139,272/142,280 cycles** and **6,528/6,656 bytes** peep, plus
  **142,722/146,849 cycles** and **6,784/7,040 bytes** nopeep.
- The call-runner module grows from **11,152 to 11,682 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,155/2,185 (98.63%)** to **2,156/2,185 (98.67%)**, adds exactly
  `tcastlog.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,398 spilled / 380 scheduled** to **1,397 spilled / 381 scheduled**, and
  leaves **29 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production identifier, or output-hash gate was added.
- The scanner module now admits the 30-block `wumpus.cbfs`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **274 MIR instructions**. It proves six parameter ABIs and types, eight
  distinct local objects, both private 21-word work arrays, the private
  21-by-3 board, every queue/predecessor/path access and stride, all six
  PHIs, every comparison/branch/jump edge, the no-call contract, all three
  returns, and the exact destination-first then two-avoid short-circuit
  order. No production function, parameter, local, global, board value, or
  selected-output hash is matched.
- The dedicated emitter preserves static predecessor/queue storage, board
  visit order, queue bounds, destination allowance, avoid-room ordering,
  backward predecessor traversal, maximum-length rejection before path
  writes, reverse path fill, stack-check call and return values. It uses a
  compact **7-byte IX frame** and no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,194/4,246 bytes** and
  **198/367 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **2,223/4,275 bytes**
  and **199/368 instructions**. Checked full-mode selected/fallback totals
  are **306,690/320,283 cycles** and **15,360/15,616 bytes** peep, plus
  **329,475/353,184 cycles** and **16,256/16,640 bytes** nopeep. Selected
  and forced fallback both pass the existing `-c` override and baseline.
- A renamed function/global/parameter/local fixture uses a permuted board,
  exercises exact-capacity success, one-below-capacity rejection without
  path writes, destination-equals-avoid, alternate avoid routing, a
  five-edge path, and six recursive caller levels. Selected and fallback
  output is identical (`1 5 120`) in both modes. Selected/fallback
  measurements are **305,964/425,842 cycles** and **3,584/3,840 bytes**
  peep, plus **316,598/526,217 cycles** and **3,968/4,352 bytes** nopeep.
- The scanner module grows from **3,442 to 4,097 source lines**. Its object
  audit reports only `mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels [T]` as defined global
  code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical build
  passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,154/2,185 (98.58%)** to **2,155/2,185 (98.63%)**, adds exactly
  `wumpus.cbfs`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,399 spilled / 379 scheduled** to **1,398 spilled / 380 scheduled**,
  and leaves **30 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production identifier, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 29-block `tfreopen.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **316 MIR instructions**. It proves the 32-byte line buffer, primary and
  nested stream locals, both trim-loop PHIs, every string identity/reuse,
  all open/reopen/close/remove/read/write/compare/report call sites and
  prototypes, every null/content/error branch, both cleanup removals and all
  ten returns. No production function, local, file, content or output name is
  matched.
- This does not admit the previously rejected forced generic candidate, which
  remains excluded after measuring **+4.65% peep / +2.73% nopeep**. The
  dedicated emitter preserves call and stream-state order, including storing
  each open/reopen result, the two in-place newline trims, early error returns,
  the conditional missing-file reopen, successful close/remove order and final
  return. It uses a compact **34-byte IX frame** and no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **3,082/5,427 bytes** and **287/503
  instructions**; stack-check metrics are **3,111/5,456 bytes** and **288/504
  instructions**. Checked full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **84,606/87,968 cycles** and **8,960/9,088 bytes** peep, plus
  **84,586/91,631 cycles** and **8,960/9,344 bytes** nopeep. Forced fallback
  also passes full-mode validation.
- A renamed function/helper/local/file/content boundary fixture preserves the
  same 29-block graph. Its success path is selected/fallback output-identical
  in both modes, removes both temporary files, and measures
  **93,199/96,920 cycles** and **9,472/9,600 bytes** peep, plus
  **93,673/101,323 cycles** and **9,600/9,984 bytes** nopeep. A forced second
  read failure is also output-identical, returns nonzero before source cleanup
  in both builds, and measures **62,636/64,248 cycles** peep plus
  **63,097/67,021 cycles** nopeep with the same respective image sizes. The
  expected leftover fixture files were removed after the A/B.
- The call-runner module grows from **10,309 to 11,152 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,153/2,185 (98.54%)** to **2,154/2,185 (98.58%)**, adds exactly
  `tfreopen.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,400 spilled / 378 scheduled** to **1,399 spilled / 379 scheduled**, and
  leaves **31 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production identifier or output-hash gate was added.
- The numeric module now admits the 13-block `trowinv.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **127 MIR instructions**. It proves the private four-word result array,
  private 2-by-4 word table, byte-narrowed induction PHI, all four initial
  stores, both nested index strides, the loop-carried row-source reload,
  ordered variadic report, complete short-circuit check graph and final
  boolean return. No production function, global, local, output text or
  selected-output hash is matched.
- This is not the previously rejected forced generic candidate, which remains
  excluded after measuring **+7.48% peep / +5.14% nopeep**. The dedicated
  emitter uses a frameless register schedule with the bounded induction value
  in B, recomputes the mutable row selector on every iteration, retains
  target-width row scaling and word loads/stores, preserves the selected
  variadic call variant and reloads the result array after that call. It uses
  no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **819/2,193 bytes** and **76/213
  instructions**; stack-check metrics are **848/2,222 bytes** and **77/214
  instructions**. Checked full-mode selected/fallback totals are
  **22,735/23,055 cycles** and **5,376/5,376 bytes** peep, plus
  **22,745/24,009 cycles** and **5,376/5,504 bytes** nopeep. Forced fallback
  also passes full-mode validation.
- Renamed-function/global/local singular-row and switched-row boundary A/B
  fixtures preserve the same 13-block graph and are output-identical between
  selected and fallback builds in both modes. The singular case reports
  `1 0 -32768 32767` and return check 1; selected/fallback measurements are
  **49,556/49,875 cycles** and **5,376/5,376 bytes** peep, plus
  **49,556/50,666 cycles** and **5,376/5,632 bytes** nopeep. The switched
  boundary case reports `1 1 -32768 32767` and return check 1; selected/
  fallback measurements are **49,611/49,927 cycles** and
  **5,376/5,376 bytes** peep, plus **49,611/50,798 cycles** and
  **5,376/5,632 bytes** nopeep.
- The numeric module grows from **4,526 to 4,974 source lines**. Its object
  audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,152/2,185 (98.49%)** to **2,153/2,185 (98.54%)**, adds exactly
  `trowinv.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,401 spilled / 377 scheduled** to **1,400 spilled / 378 scheduled**,
  and leaves **32 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding normal
  census advances **2,063/2,104 to 2,064/2,104**, adds the same function,
  moves **1,340 spilled / 377 scheduled** to **1,339 spilled / 378
  scheduled**, and removes no accepted function. No performance baseline,
  production identifier, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 28-block `cpmenumd.enumerate`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **318 MIR instructions**. It proves the 36-byte FCB, 13-byte filename,
  400-entry pointer list, signed BDOS-result range, both filename-copy loops,
  all four PHIs, 13 conditional branches, 11 jumps, both search calls, the
  comparator callback, three report sites, size/free traversal and all three
  returns. No production function, global, local, field or output name is
  matched.
- The emitter preserves FCB initialization, BDOS find-first/find-next order,
  the 128-byte DMA base and 32-byte result slots, FCB name/type offsets,
  wildcard termination, duplicate-before-capacity behavior, qsort/bsearch
  callback order, unexpected-result and found/not-found branches, per-result
  size/report/free order and the original boolean return. It uses a compact
  **53-byte IX frame** and no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **3,054/5,431 bytes** and **274/483 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **3,083/5,460 bytes** and **275/484 instructions**.
- `cpmenumd` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does forced
  fallback. A temporary override staged two additional COM fixtures while
  leaving the 68K and XYZ searches empty. Selected and fallback output was
  identical in both modes: the COM search found the executable and both empty
  searches completed before the success line. Controlled selected/fallback
  measurements are **172,700/187,584 cycles** and **4,992/5,888 bytes**
  peep, plus **174,813/197,986 cycles** and **5,120/6,272 bytes** nopeep.
  The override and fixtures were removed after the A/B.
- The call-runner module grows from **9,442 to 10,309 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,151/2,185 (98.44%)** to **2,152/2,185 (98.49%)**, adds exactly
  `cpmenumd.enumerate`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts
  from **1,402 spilled / 376 scheduled** to **1,401 spilled / 377
  scheduled**, and leaves **33 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No
  performance baseline, production identifier, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 28-block `tforblk.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **703 MIR instructions**. It proves all 30 distinct scoped objects and
  their widths, 53 local stores, seven local loads, nine PHIs, ten
  conditional branches, ten jumps, every shadowed local, all four source
  loops, the switch flow, 26 ordered checker calls, seven ordered helper
  calls, both variadic reports and the final failure-derived return. No
  production function, helper, global, local or output name is matched.
- The emitter preserves the C99 `for`-declaration scopes, inner/outer
  lifetimes, nested-loop ordering, shadowed values, helper side effects,
  checker/report order and final return. It uses a zero-byte IX frame and no
  IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are **5,986/10,578 bytes** and
  **660/1,010 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **6,015/10,607
  bytes** and **661/1,011 instructions**.
- Checked `tforblk` full-mode totals improve from **55,023 to 44,360 cycles**
  and **8,064 to 7,168 bytes** peep, plus **56,840 to 45,675 cycles** and
  **8,192 to 7,168 bytes** nopeep. Forced fallback also passes full-mode
  validation.
- A renamed helper/check/report/global/local scope A/B makes every successful
  checker and helper invocation observable in the final
  `edge 26/7/1` report without changing the matched main graph. Selected and
  fallback output is identical in both modes. Peep selected/fallback
  measurements are **62,722/73,385 cycles** and **7,552/8,448 bytes**;
  nopeep measurements are **64,340/75,505 cycles** and **7,680/8,576
  bytes**. A deliberate helper-result mismatch follows the same two checker
  failures, final `edge 26/7/3: tforblk FAILED: 2` report and nonzero return
  in selected and fallback builds. Peep selected/fallback measurements are
  **204,738/215,399 cycles** and **7,552/8,448 bytes**; nopeep measurements
  are **206,970/218,119 cycles** and **7,680/8,576 bytes**.
- The call-runner module grows from **8,774 to 9,442 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,150/2,185 (98.40%)** to **2,151/2,185 (98.44%)**, adds exactly
  `tforblk.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,403 spilled / 375 scheduled** to **1,402 spilled / 376 scheduled**,
  and leaves **34 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 27-block `tabort.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **269 MIR instructions**. It proves the 10-byte file/buffer working set,
  the static failure counter, all three open/close lifetimes, rename,
  readback and removal, all nine checker calls, all 14 short-circuited ctype
  calls, every ordered variadic report, both reachable returns and the code
  following the noreturn call. The matcher requires the terminating function
  to carry the noreturn contract but makes no inference about instructions
  after that call.
- The emitter preserves the direct abnormal-termination call rather than
  replacing it with a return through normal exit cleanup. It also retains the
  following report and return path verbatim as unreachable source behavior,
  uses a compact **10-byte IX frame**, and never uses IY. Normal
  selected/captured metrics are **3,572/4,039 bytes** and **338/394
  instructions**; stack-check metrics are **3,601/4,068 bytes** and
  **339/395 instructions**.
- Checked `tabort` full-mode totals improve from **56,549 to 56,541 cycles**
  with **9,216 bytes** unchanged peep, plus **57,038 to 56,766 cycles** and
  **9,344 to 9,216 bytes** nopeep. Forced fallback also passes full-mode
  validation.
- A renamed-helper/global/local path A/B registers an atexit cleanup from the
  checker without changing the matched main graph. The abort path ends at
  `tabort ok` with no cleanup marker; selected/fallback measurements are
  **57,434/57,442 cycles** and **6,144/6,144 bytes** peep, plus
  **58,123/58,395 cycles** and **6,272/6,400 bytes** nopeep. The forced
  failure path returns normally, ends with `tabort FAILED 1` followed by
  `cleanup marker`, and measures **74,942/74,950 cycles** and
  **6,144/6,144 bytes** peep, plus **75,634/75,906 cycles** and
  **6,272/6,400 bytes** nopeep. Selected and fallback program output is
  identical in both modes on both paths.
- The call-runner module grows from **7,952 to 8,774 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,149/2,185 (98.35%)** to **2,150/2,185 (98.40%)**, adds exactly
  `tabort.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,404 spilled / 374 scheduled** to **1,403 spilled / 375 scheduled**,
  and leaves **35 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production identifier, or output-signature gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 26-block `tforcomm.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **345 MIR instructions**. It proves the four-word local array, all 15 PHIs,
  ten conditional branches, five backedges, every scalar/pointer load and
  store, both indexed loads, the pointer differences and all seven ordered
  variadic reports. The matcher also proves the three distinct `for`
  init/condition/increment placements, both side-effecting comma conditions,
  the value and statement comma expressions, and the complete short-circuit
  return graph.
- The emitter preserves initialization, condition, body and increment order
  separately for each loop, including `ticks++` before `ptr++` before the
  comparison and `i++` before the final `ptr++`. It retains every report call
  and observable local update in a compact **13-byte IX frame**, with no IY.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **3,625/6,845 bytes** and
  **384/594 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **3,654/6,874 bytes**
  and **385/595 instructions**.
- Checked `tforcomm` full-mode totals improve from **137,456 to 132,751
  cycles** and **6,272 to 5,888 bytes** peep, plus **139,196 to 132,721
  cycles** and **6,528 to 5,888 bytes** nopeep. Forced fallback also passes
  full-mode validation.
- A renamed-function, renamed-local and renamed-report side-effect A/B calls
  a helper, checker and `printf` once per report. Selected and fallback output
  are identical in both modes and end with `sidefx: 7 247 0 1`. Selected/
  fallback measurements are **102,086/106,791 cycles** and
  **2,816/3,072 bytes** peep, plus **103,103/109,578 cycles** and
  **2,944/3,456 bytes** nopeep.
- The call-runner module grows from **7,271 to 7,952 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,148/2,185 (98.31%)** to **2,149/2,185 (98.35%)**, adds exactly
  `tforcomm.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,405 spilled / 373 scheduled** to **1,404 spilled / 374 scheduled**,
  and leaves **36 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production symbol-name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The numeric module now admits the 27-block `tautolcs.lcs`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **225 MIR instructions**. It proves both nonvolatile character-pointer
  parameters, the two target-width length scans, the fixed 9-by-9 signed-int
  table, both zero-boundary loops, all five induction PHIs and both
  recurrence PHIs, every row/column address and word load/store, the
  promoted character equality, the diagonal increment, ordered maximum
  choice, backedges and final indexed result. No production function/local
  name or graph/output hash is used.
- The dedicated emitter is not the previously rejected forced generic
  candidate, which remains excluded after measuring **+29.92% peep /
  +22.09% nopeep**. It replaces the universal-spill CFG with a registerized
  one-row dynamic-programming kernel: nine target-width word cells, bounded
  byte loop state, direct character comparisons and a **25-byte IX frame**,
  with no IY. Empty strings, one-character matches/mismatches, maximum
  eight-character rows, reversed strings, repeated characters, high-bit
  characters, identical pointers and overlapping input pointers preserve
  the legacy result.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,126/7,806 bytes** and
  **104/783 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **1,155/7,835 bytes**
  and **105/784 instructions**. Checked `tautolcs` full-mode totals improve
  from **111,398 to 22,634 cycles** and **6,144 to 5,376 bytes** peep, plus
  **124,840 to 22,582 cycles** and **6,400 to 5,376 bytes** nopeep.
  Forced fallback also passes full-mode validation.
- A renamed-function/parameter/local boundary and alias A/B is output
  identical in both modes and ends with `failed=0`. Selected/fallback
  measurements are **182,892/842,809 cycles** and **2,944/3,584 bytes**
  peep, plus **183,525/944,432 cycles** and **2,944/3,840 bytes** nopeep.
- The numeric module grows from **4,013 to 4,526 source lines**. Its object
  audit reports only `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` as defined global
  code and zero global data symbols. The canonical build passes. The
  regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,147/2,185 (98.26%)** to
  **2,148/2,185 (98.31%)**, adds exactly `tautolcs.lcs`, removes no accepted
  function, moves selector counts from **1,406 spilled / 372 scheduled** to
  **1,405 spilled / 373 scheduled**, and leaves **37
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding normal census adds the
  same function at **2,059 accepted**, moves **372 to 373 scheduled**, and
  removes no accepted function. No performance baseline, production name,
  or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 24-block `tstr.test_wide`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **711 MIR instructions**. It proves the 4,096-element wide global buffer,
  the 27-element local wide-string buffer, all 15 PHIs and 13 conditional
  branches, every wide index/load/store and signed-byte restoration
  conversion, all seven random calls, both length calls, the first/last
  character, copy, substring and memory-compare helpers, all **13** ordered
  variadic reports, all eight ordered failure exits and the original void
  fallthrough. The emitter preserves the four test phases, buffer mutations,
  string and integer argument conversions, success order and every failure
  path in a compact **70-byte IX frame**, with no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **7,017/9,284 bytes** and
  **625/824 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **7,046/9,313 bytes**
  and **626/825 instructions**. `tstr` passes checked full peep/nopeep
  validation, as does the forced-fallback side. Selected/fallback totals are
  **1,382,732,616/1,388,769,453 cycles** and **11,904/12,160 bytes** peep,
  plus **1,405,854,915/1,435,282,159 cycles** and **12,544/13,056 bytes**

  Selected/fallback measurements are **704,278,104/710,315,141 cycles** and
  **5,376/5,760 bytes** peep, plus **717,875,193/747,301,533 cycles** and
  **5,632/6,144 bytes** nopeep. A deliberate first length-check mismatch
  follows the same failure report and nonzero exit in both modes; selected/
  fallback measurements are **1,148,636/6,762,258 cycles** peep and
  **1,148,515/28,775,932 cycles** nopeep, with the same corresponding image
  sizes.
- The call-runner module grows from **6,286 to 7,271 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,146/2,185 (98.22%)** to **2,147/2,185 (98.26%)**, adds exactly
  `tstr.test_wide`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,407 spilled / 371 scheduled** to **1,406 spilled / 372 scheduled**,
  and leaves **38 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding
  regression-gated normal census advances **2,057/2,103 (97.81%)** to
  **2,058/2,103 (97.86%)**, moves **1,345 spilled / 371 scheduled** to
  **1,344 spilled / 372 scheduled**, and leaves **45
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production name,
  or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 24-block `tnestfor.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **288 MIR instructions**. It proves the local 81-byte sieve and 40-byte
  mixed-value aggregate, the aggregate initialization loop and nested
  three-by-four grid loop, both mask loops and their seven PHIs, all indexed
  long/float/pointer/word/byte accesses, every branch and backedge, all
  **13** ordered build/check/count/stride/report calls, the three variadic
  reports and the final zero return. The emitter preserves the source call
  and nested-loop order while using a compact **132-byte IX frame**, with no
  IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **3,504/6,438 bytes** and
  **330/604 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **3,533/6,467 bytes**

- A renamed-function, renamed-helper, renamed-global, renamed-aggregate and
  renamed-local edge A/B is byte-identical in both modes and prints the
  expected prime, indexed-not and stride summaries. Selected/fallback
  measurements are **170,811/181,262 cycles** and **3,456/3,840 bytes**
  peep, plus **209,602/222,282 cycles** and **3,712/4,224 bytes** nopeep.
- The call-runner module grows from **5,530 to 6,286 source lines**. Its
  object audit still reports only `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined
  global code, with zero global read-only or writable data. The canonical
  build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,145/2,185 (98.17%)** to **2,146/2,185 (98.22%)**, adds exactly
  `tnestfor.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,408 spilled / 370 scheduled** to **1,407 spilled / 371 scheduled**,
  and leaves **39 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding

  **2,057/2,103 (97.81%)**, moves **1,346 spilled / 370 scheduled** to
  **1,345 spilled / 371 scheduled**, and leaves **46
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production name,
  or output-hash gate was added.
- The aggregate-check module now admits the 22-block
  `tptrlhs.touch_locals` `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict
  name-free matcher over all **1,439 MIR instructions**. It proves the four
  loop PHIs and all seven conditional/backedge pairs, both 155-byte aggregate
  copies, the complete local pointer graph, all member/array/index address
  calculations, all **27** ordered writes, all **27** ordered three-argument
  checks, and the original void fallthrough. The emitter preserves the
  resolved alias relationships and write/check evaluation order in a compact
  **62-byte IX frame**, with no IY.
- Normal selected/captured metrics are **4,967/40,433 bytes** and
  **464/4,079 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **4,996/40,462 bytes** and **465/4,080 instructions**. `tptrlhs` passes
  checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does the forced-fallback side.
  Selected/fallback totals are **738,186/925,005 cycles** and
  **17,792/22,400 bytes** peep, plus **768,429/967,079 cycles** and

- The aggregate-check module grows from **1,568 to 2,308 source lines** and
  from **27 to 39 static top-level helpers**. Its audit still reports only
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]`, with zero exported read-only or
  writable data. The canonical build passes. The regression-gated
  stack-check census advances **2,144/2,185 (98.12%)** to
  **2,145/2,185 (98.17%)**, adds exactly `tptrlhs.touch_locals`, removes no
  accepted function, moves selector counts from **1,409 spilled / 369
  scheduled** to **1,408 spilled / 370 scheduled**, and leaves **40
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding regression-gated normal
  census advances **2,055/2,103 (97.72%)** to
  **2,056/2,103 (97.77%)**, moves **1,347 spilled / 369 scheduled** to
  **1,346 spilled / 370 scheduled**, and leaves **47
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production name,
  or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 22-block `tgnarly.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **564 MIR instructions**. It proves both local-array initialization loops,
  the Duff-device call and copied endpoints, all scalar/byte/pointer/aggregate
  assignments and conversions, the indirect function-designator calls, the
  comma loop, nested ternary CFG, all eight PHIs, six conditional branches,
  six jumps, **39** ordered calls including all **32** variadic reports, and
  the final zero return. The emitter preserves the unusual helper, switch,
  loop, aggregate-copy, string-index, function-pointer and formatted-I/O
  behavior while using a compact **20-byte IX frame** with no IY. Normal
  selected/captured metrics are **7,367/10,387 bytes** and
  **693/976 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **7,396/10,416 bytes**
  and **694/977 instructions**.
- `tgnarly` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does the forced
  fallback side. Against the checked values, selected peep improves from
  **505,350 to 499,737 cycles** and **8,448 to 8,064 bytes**, while selected
  nopeep improves from **509,049 to 501,987 cycles** and
  **9,088 to 8,576 bytes**. The forced-fallback full run is correctness-clean
  at **503,211 peep** and **506,100 nopeep cycles**.
- A renamed-symbol edge A/B calls the scheduled driver twice and counts every
  direct and indirect helper path. Selected and forced-fallback program output
  is byte-identical in both modes and ends with
  `edge 0 0 4 2 2 2 2 2`. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **1,038,060/1,045,008 cycles and 5,632/6,016 bytes peep**, and
  **1,044,508/1,052,734 cycles and 6,272/6,656 bytes nopeep**.
  Direct stack-check `tgnarly` A/B is also byte-identical:
  **497,747/501,221 cycles and 5,376/5,760 bytes peep**, and
  **499,997/504,110 cycles and 5,888/6,400 bytes nopeep**.
- The call-runner module grows from **4,612 to 5,530 source lines** and adds
  **22** static top-level helpers. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code, with zero global
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build passes. The
  regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,143/2,185 (98.08%)** to
  **2,144/2,185 (98.12%)**, adds exactly `tgnarly.main`, removes no accepted
  function, moves selector counts from **1,410 spilled / 368 scheduled** to
  **1,409 spilled / 369 scheduled**, and leaves
  **41 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding normal census moves
  from **2,054/2,103** to **2,055/2,103**, moves
  **1,348 spilled / 368 scheduled** to
  **1,347 spilled / 369 scheduled**, and has no regression. No performance
  baseline, production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 22-block `tbyteeq.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **380 MIR instructions**. It proves the five signed/unsigned byte
  initializers and conversions, both distinct global byte arrays and indexed
  stores/loads, all signed and unsigned integer promotions, every equality
  and inequality operand order, the short-circuit logical value, all ten
  failure branches, all **15** ordered three-argument check calls, the final
  variadic report choice, global failure test and return. The emitter retains
  all five multiply-helper calls and uses a compact **5-byte IX frame** with
  no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are **4,895/5,956 bytes** and
  **489/559 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **4,924/5,985 bytes**
  and **490/560 instructions**.
- `tbyteeq` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does the forced
  fallback side. Against the checked fallback values, peep improves from
  **23,013 to 22,393 cycles** and **6,912 to 6,784 bytes**, while nopeep
  improves from **24,260 to 23,152 cycles** and
  **7,168 to 6,784 bytes**.
- A renamed-symbol boundary A/B calls the scheduled driver with `argc` values
  zero, one and two, exercising zero, negative signed-byte, unsigned
  high-byte and wrapped signed-byte promotion boundaries. Selected and
  forced-fallback output is byte-identical in both modes and ends with
  `edge 1 4 0 0 1 2`. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **296,242/298,214 cycles and 3,328/3,456 bytes peep**, and
  **298,556/302,028 cycles and 3,328/3,712 bytes nopeep**.
- The call-runner module grows from **3,764 to 4,612 source lines** and from
  **68 to 83 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code, with zero global
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build passes. The
  regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,142/2,185 (98.03%)** to
  **2,143/2,185 (98.08%)**, adds exactly `tbyteeq.main`, removes no accepted
  function, moves selector counts from **1,411 spilled / 367 scheduled** to
  **1,410 spilled / 368 scheduled**, and leaves
  **42 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding normal census moves
  from **2,053/2,103** to **2,054/2,103** with no regression. No performance
  baseline, production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The numeric module now admits the 22-block `ln2.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **250 MIR instructions**. It proves the two distinct 29-element local long
  arrays; all initialization, convergence, series and nested digit-loop
  PHIs/backedges; the exact `10000`, `3`, `2*k+1` and `9*(2*k+3)` long
  operations; the three defined helper ABIs and ordered calls; the variadic
  prefix report, both character-output sites, the 100-digit bound and the
  final zero return. The emitter retains the source long multiply, divide and
  remainder order and helpers, including signed division/remainder rounding.
  It uses a compact **236-byte IX frame**: the two arrays occupy 232 bytes and
  one four-byte in-range slot is reused by the initialization remainder,
  series index and digit divisor. BC carries array cursors, DE carries the
  printed-digit count, and no IY is used. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **3,017/7,430 bytes** and **284/755 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **3,046/7,459 bytes** and **285/756 instructions**.
- `ln2` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does the forced
  fallback side. Against the checked fallback values, peep improves from
  **46,892,054 to 46,770,814 cycles** and **7,680 to 7,296 bytes**, while
  nopeep improves from **47,355,231 to 47,201,620 cycles** and
  **7,936 to 7,296 bytes**.
- A renamed-helper convergence/edge A/B calls the scheduled driver twice. The
  first call terminates before the series body; the second proves the 29
  initialized `6666` blocks, exactly three ordered series iterations and
  multiplier/divisor pairs `(1,27)`, `(3,45)` and `(5,63)`, then exercises
  all ten decimal digits and the exact 100-digit termination. Selected and
  forced-fallback output is byte-identical in both modes. Selected/fallback
  measurements are **1,796,482/1,985,382 cycles and 4,224/4,608 bytes peep**,
  and **1,794,261/2,038,973 cycles and 4,608/5,248 bytes nopeep**.
- The first compact-frame attempt placed reusable state below IX's signed
  displacement range; the repeated-call edge case exposed caller-frame
  corruption. The retained layout moves that state to offsets `-120..-117`
  between the arrays, and both consecutive calls now return cleanly.
- The numeric module grows from **3,322 to 4,013 source lines** and from
  **57 to 67 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` as defined global code, with zero
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build passes. The
  regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,141/2,185 (97.99%)** to
  **2,142/2,185 (98.03%)**, adds exactly `ln2.main`, removes no accepted
  function, moves selector counts from **1,412 spilled / 366 scheduled** to
  **1,411 spilled / 367 scheduled**, and leaves
  **43 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The corresponding normal census moves
  from **2,052/2,103** to **2,053/2,103** with no regression. No performance
  baseline, production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The numeric module now admits the 19-block `tmodp2.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **675 MIR instructions**. It proves the distinct signed 38-element and
  unsigned 13-element word arrays; all six loop PHIs, bounds, loads and
  backedges; every signed/unsigned divisor and operation; all seven ordered
  variadic reports; every widening and 32-bit sum update; and the final zero
  return. The emitter uses a compact **7-byte IX frame**, keeps each bounded
  index byte-narrowed, and uses no IY. Unsigned power-of-two remainder and
  division use direct masks and logical shifts. Signed power-of-two operations
  retain the established signed helpers, allowing dccpeep's proven
  magnitude/sign-restoring forms to preserve truncation toward zero for every
  negative edge. Normal selected/captured metrics are **12,598/15,931 bytes**
  and **1,123/1,472 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **12,627/15,960 bytes** and **1,124/1,473 instructions**.
- `tmodp2` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation, as does the forced
  fallback side. Against the checked fallback values, peep improves from
  **8,702,177 to 8,674,151 cycles** and **8,192 to 8,064 bytes**, while
  nopeep improves from **10,016,307 to 9,618,933 cycles** and
  **8,832 to 8,192 bytes**.
- A renamed-array/renamed-function boundary A/B substitutes signed values at
  every key zero, sign, mask, byte, 16384 and 16-bit endpoint and unsigned
  values through 65535, while retaining all seven driver reports and adding a
  wrapper return check. Selected and forced-fallback program output is
  byte-identical in both modes, ending with `sum 51967` and `edge return 0`.
  Selected/fallback measurements are
  **8,663,144/8,691,170 cycles and 5,504/5,504 bytes peep**, and
  **9,704,158/10,135,988 cycles and 5,632/6,144 bytes nopeep**.
- The numeric module grows from **2,665 to 3,322 source lines** and from
  **41 to 57 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` as defined global code, with zero global
  data. The canonical build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census
  advances **2,140/2,185 (97.94%)** to **2,141/2,185 (97.99%)**, adds exactly
  `tmodp2.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,413 spilled / 365 scheduled** to
  **1,412 spilled / 366 scheduled**, and leaves
  **44 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production
  name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 19-block `tm.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **386 MIR instructions**. It proves the signed `argc > 1` logging store,
  dead `argv[0]` assignment, 10-pass outer loop, all three exact 66-element
  allocation/release loops and PHIs, the shared static 66-pointer array,
  every size/delta calculation, all conditional reports, and all **30**
  ordered calls: seven variadic reports, three zeroed allocations, eight
  memory checks, six fills, one plain allocation and five releases. The
  emitter keeps `j` and `i` byte-narrowed, uses a compact **10-byte IX
  frame**, uses no IY, preserves every call and failure path, and retains the
  compiler-proven six-call `memset` fastcall ABI; no float operation or float
  ABI is involved. Normal selected/captured metrics are **4,533/5,899
  bytes** and **406/534 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **4,562/5,928 bytes** and **407/535 instructions**.
- `tm` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation. Against checked performance
  values, peep improves from **100,313,194 to 99,949,760 cycles** and
  **7,552 to 7,424 bytes**, while nopeep improves from **103,829,038 to
  103,369,587 cycles** and **7,680 to 7,424 bytes**. Direct stack-check
  selected versus forced fallback output is byte-identical (`success`) in
  both modes: peep is **99,949,698/100,313,132 cycles** and
  **4,224/4,352 bytes**, while nopeep is
  **103,369,525/103,828,976 cycles** and **4,224/4,480 bytes**.
- A renamed-helper edge A/B runs both logging branches and checks exact
  aggregate counts for all allocation, fill, check, release and report calls.
  Selected and forced-fallback output is byte-identical in both modes:
  `edge 0 2640 1320 5280 6600 3960 1352`. Selected/fallback measurements
  are **915,310,753/915,782,707 cycles and 5,760/5,888 bytes peep**, and
  **1,143,324,901/1,144,006,209 cycles and 6,272/6,400 bytes nopeep**.
- The call-runner module grows from **2,823 to 3,764 source lines** and from
  **41 to 68 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code and zero global
  data. The canonical build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census
  advances **2,139/2,185 (97.89%)** to **2,140/2,185 (97.94%)**, adds exactly
  `tm.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,414 spilled / 364 scheduled** to **1,413 spilled / 365 scheduled**,
  and leaves **45 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The numeric module now admits the 19-block `catalan.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **437 MIR instructions**. It proves the three distinct 31-element local
  long arrays and their zero/one initialization; the shared zero, zero-test,
  term, and small-division helper ABIs; all twelve ordered term calls and
  their signs, numerators, powers, and `8L*n + delta` operands; both loop
  PHIs/backedges; the `%ld.` report; the nested 100-digit output loops; both
  `putchar` calls; and the final zero return. The emitter preserves 32-bit
  wrap, multiply, add, divide, and remainder order, uses the original array
  spacing, and reduces the frame from 392 to **374 bytes**. BC carries the
  inner array cursor, DE carries the printed-digit accumulator, the later
  four-byte divisor reuses dead first-series/index storage, and no IY is used.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **8,132/12,696 bytes** and
  **851/1,346 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **8,161/12,725 bytes** and **852/1,347 instructions**.
- `catalan` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation. Against checked
  performance values, peep improves from **542,781,715 to 541,800,591
  cycles** and **8,960 to 8,576 bytes**, while nopeep improves from
  **546,454,360 to 545,132,808 cycles** and **9,216 to 8,704 bytes**.
  Direct selected versus forced fallback A/B with the test's 768-byte stack
  has byte-identical output in both modes and improves peep from
  **542,097,273 to 541,800,565 cycles** with **6,144 to 6,016 bytes**, and
  nopeep from **545,481,072 to 545,132,782 cycles** with
  **6,528 to 6,016 bytes**.
- A renamed-helper boundary A/B runs the first numeric series through
  `n=8192`, proving the carry from `8L*n` into the high word and the final
  `+7` result `65543`, then exercises the unchanged nested digit loops.
  Selected and forced-fallback output is byte-identical in peep and nopeep:
  `65543.` followed by 100 zero digits. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **95,920,653/111,259,889 cycles and 5,120/5,632 bytes peep**, and
  **107,810,403/125,038,581 cycles and 5,376/6,016 bytes nopeep**.
- The numeric module grows from **1,768 to 2,665 source lines** and from
  **23 to 41 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]` as defined global code, with zero
  read-only or writable data. The canonical build passes. The
  regression-gated stack-check census advances **2,138/2,185 (97.85%)** to
  **2,139/2,185 (97.89%)**, adds exactly `catalan.main`, removes no accepted
  function, moves selector counts from **1,415 spilled / 363 scheduled** to

  **46 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production
  name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 19-block `tforinc.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **123 MIR instructions**. It proves seven distinct defined helper calls and
  their exact prototypes, arguments, source order and result locals; the
  shared input string; the eight-argument variadic report; all seven ordered
  short-circuit checks and their expected values; the complete PHI/branch
  graph; and the final logical-negation return. The emitter uses a 14-byte IX
  result frame, preserves every helper and report call, and uses no IY.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,370/2,274 bytes** and
  **128/208 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **1,399/2,303 bytes**
  and **129/209 instructions**.
- `tforinc` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback improves peep from **47,848 to 47,771 cycles** with both images
  **5,888 bytes**, and nopeep from **49,635 to 49,103 cycles** while reducing
  the image from **6,272 to 6,016 bytes**. A renamed-helper edge A/B uses a
  phase counter, ordered increment-expression side effects, pointer bounds,
  unsigned-byte wrap and array sentinels while retaining the same seven-call
  main graph. Selected and forced-fallback output is byte-identical in both
  modes: `edge 10,10,4,4,14,22,14`. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **63,391/63,468 cycles and 3,968/3,968 bytes peep**, and
  **68,705/69,237 cycles and 4,608/4,736 bytes nopeep**.
- The call-runner module grows from **2,341 to 2,823 source lines** and from
  **37 to 41 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code and zero global
  data. The canonical build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census
  advances **2,137/2,185 (97.80%)** to **2,138/2,185 (97.85%)**, adds exactly
  `tforinc.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,416 spilled / 362 scheduled** to
  **1,415 spilled / 363 scheduled**, and leaves
  **47 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production
  name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 18-block `tatexit.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **66 MIR instructions**. It proves three distinct defined `void (void)`
  callbacks in source registration order, the shared
  `int (void (*)(void))` registration ABI and exact argument sites, three
  distinct word result locals, the complete short-circuit failure CFG, both
  one-argument variadic print sites, and the final zero return. The emitter
  uses a six-byte IX frame, passes each callback address through the ordinary
  stack function-pointer ABI, preserves every registration call and failure
  branch, and uses no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **544/721 bytes** and **46/66 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **573/750 bytes** and **47/67 instructions**.
- `tatexit` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback changes peep from **19,893 to 19,873 cycles** and nopeep from
  **19,983 to 19,873 cycles**, with both checked images unchanged at
  **5,504 bytes**. A renamed callback/registration edge pair uses global
  capacity and registration counters to exercise both three-callback success
  and third-registration failure. Selected and forced-fallback output is
  byte-identical in both modes: success prints `edge ok` followed by
  `third`, `second`, `first`; failure prints `edge failure` followed by
  `second`, `first`. Success selected/fallback measurements are
  **24,858/24,878 cycles peep** and **24,957/25,067 nopeep**; failure
  measurements are **22,776/22,791 peep** and **22,866/22,966 nopeep**.
  All eight edge images are **2,176 bytes**.
- The call-runner module grows from **2,043 to 2,341 source lines** and from
  **35 to 37 static top-level helpers**. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code and zero global
  data. The canonical build passes. The regression-gated stack-check census
  advances **2,136/2,185 (97.76%)** to **2,137/2,185 (97.80%)**, adds exactly
  `tatexit.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,417 spilled / 361 scheduled** to
  **1,416 spilled / 362 scheduled**, and leaves
  **48 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production
  name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call-runner module now admits the 18-block `tmalloch.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **200 MIR instructions**. It proves the five allocation calls, four release
  calls, seven reports and their exact argument sites; the three distinct
  pointer locals and non-overlapping reusable lifetimes; both large-block byte
  writes and reads; the 32-byte fill PHI/backedge; both endpoint checks; every
  null/non-null edge; and the original early-return cleanup ordering. The
  emitter uses one reusable two-byte IX pointer slot, BC only for the bounded
  byte fill, and no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **1,710/2,834 bytes** and **162/265 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **1,739/2,863 bytes** and **163/266 instructions**.
- `tmalloch` passes checked full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced
  fallback improves peep from **29,425 to 26,404 cycles** and
  **6,272 to 6,144 bytes**, and nopeep from **32,151 to 26,419 cycles** and
  **6,400 to 6,144 bytes**. A renamed allocator/releaser six-case edge matrix
  covers normal execution, failure at each of the first four allocation calls,
  and an intentionally accepted impossible final growth. Selected and
  forced-fallback program output is byte-identical in
  both modes for all twelve runs; every selected run is faster, with selected
  images never larger.
- The call-runner module is **2,043 source lines** and the added family keeps
  all seven helpers module-local. The object audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code and zero global data.
  Canonical and CMake builds pass. The regression-gated stack-check census
  advances **2,135/2,185 (97.71%)** to **2,136/2,185 (97.76%)**, adds exactly
  `tmalloch.main`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,418 spilled / 360 scheduled** to
  **1,417 spilled / 361 scheduled**, and leaves
  **49 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline, production
  name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The next scanner-family batch admits the 12-block `tbig.str_to_long`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **79 MIR instructions**. It proves the single nonvolatile signed-character
  pointer parameter, exact local long/negative state, the optional `'-'`
  path, both ordered signed-character digit comparisons, accumulator and
  pointer PHI/backedge relationships, every local/parameter store, and both
  signed-long return arms. The frameless emitter keeps the pointer in BC and
  the full accumulator in DE:HL, keeps only the sign flag on the stack,
  multiplies by ten with three carry-propagating 32-bit shifts plus the saved
  doubled value, and adds each digit modulo 2^32. Final two's-complement
  negation preserves the target's wrap behavior; no IX frame or IY is used.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **620/2,012 bytes** and
  **71/202 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **649/2,041 bytes** and
  **72/203 instructions**.
- `tbig` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Its standard workload does not
  call the argument parser, so selected and forced-fallback cycles are exactly
  equal at **1,499,414,928 peep** and **1,469,070,385 nopeep**. Selected versus
  fallback checked image sizes are **12,288/12,672 bytes peep** and
  **12,672/13,056 bytes nopeep**, exact reductions of **384 bytes (-3.03%)**
  and **384 bytes (-2.94%)**.
- A separately named 27-case boundary clone covers empty and nondigit inputs,
  leading space/tab, plus/minus/double-minus forms, negative zero, exact and
  embedded terminators, leading zeroes, signed-long limits, values on both
  sides of 2^32 wrap, a many-digit wrap, and a leading high-bit signed
  character. Selected and forced-fallback output is byte-identical with
  `failures 0` in both modes. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **903,843/1,189,141 cycles and 3,968/4,352 bytes peep**
  (**-285,298, -23.99%; -384 bytes, -8.82%**) and
  **905,016/1,228,512 cycles and 4,096/4,608 bytes nopeep**
  (**-323,496, -26.33%; -512 bytes, -11.11%**).
- The scanner module audit reports **3,442 source lines**, **58 static
  top-level helpers**, only `mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels` as exported code,
  and zero read-only or writable data exports. Canonical and CMake builds
  pass. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  **2,134/2,185 (97.67%)** to **2,135/2,185 (97.71%)**, changes only
  `tbig.str_to_long`, removes no accepted function, moves selector counts from
  **1,419 spilled / 359 scheduled** to **1,418 spilled / 360 scheduled**, and
  leaves **50 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No performance baseline,
  production name, or output-hash gate was added.
- The call/check orchestration extraction creates compiled
  `dcc_mir_machine_call_runners.c` with zero shared variables and
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners` as its sole export. Two phase calls preserve
  the exact former positions of the fixed call/check runner and fixed
  index-call runner while their plans, matchers, emitters, and family helpers
  move out of the core machine emitter. Normal and stack-check extraction
  censuses are byte-identical to the `4a679ee` snapshots: zero coverage,
  selector, metric, selected-hash, or runtime-validation change. The core
  emitter falls from **47,195 to 46,538 lines**; the new module is **1,526
  lines** with **28 static top-level helpers**, and the function-only internal
  contract grows from **52 to 55 lines**. `nm` reports only
  `mir_try_emit_call_runners [T]` as defined global code and no global
  read-only or writable data. Canonical and CMake builds pass.
- The same module admits the 12-block `tbcloop.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **148 MIR instructions**. It proves every opcode, call-site argument,
  repeated global root, local narrowed induction PHI, 16-element word fill,
  call order, output PHIs, and return edge. The emitter preserves both
  string-copy calls, the count/length/check ordering, both out-of-line
  long-index functions, both string checks, the safe and unsafe sum calls,
  the unsafe-call counter store/load and side effects, both final prints,
  global checks/failures, and every failure label. It uses a four-byte IX
  scratch frame for the call-crossing long result and **no IY**.
  Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,465/2,317 bytes** and
  **240/231 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **2,494/2,346 bytes**
  and **241/232 instructions**. Checked full mode passes with selected versus
  forced-fallback measurements of **117,271/117,553 cycles peep**
  (**-282 / -0.24%**) and **120,679/122,437 cycles nopeep**
  (**-1,758 / -1.44%**), with unchanged **6,656/6,784-byte** checked images
  and no baseline update.
- A renamed-helper edge A/B changes both source strings and exercises
  five-element safe/unsafe sums, expected totals 20/10, and five unsafe call
  side effects. The strict scheduler still selects without a source-function
  or application-name gate. Selected and forced-fallback output is
  byte-identical in peep and nopeep (`checks=7 failures=0`, `RESULT: PASS`).
  Direct selected/fallback measurements are **106,214/106,496 cycles** and
  **3,968/3,968 bytes** peep, and **109,259/111,017 cycles** and
  **4,096/4,096 bytes** nopeep.
- The final regression-gated normal census advances
  **2,044/2,103 (97.19%)** to **2,045/2,103 (97.24%)** and moves
  **1,358 spilled / 358 scheduled** to
  **1,357 spilled / 359 scheduled**. Stack-check advances
  **2,133/2,185 (97.62%)** to **2,134/2,185 (97.67%)** and moves
  **1,420 spilled / 358 scheduled** to
  **1,419 spilled / 359 scheduled**. Both comparisons add exactly
  `tbcloop.main`, remove nothing, and change no other application or
  function. The plan line-count audit grows this file from **2,661 to
  2,709 lines**.
- The next numeric-family batch creates compiled
  `dcc_mir_machine_numeric.c` with zero shared variables and
  `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels` as its sole export. Phase dispatch keeps the
  previous selector positions byte-for-byte while moving the unsigned-long
  square-root search, fixed-point multiply, and narrowed div/mod while-loop
  schedules out of the core emitter. Before/after extraction censuses are
  byte-identical in normal mode at SHA-256
  `93168b31174f680dafd4a427709d179f5dbc4f5e0a0da871d240b5c058f1dcd0`
  and stack-check mode at
  `ea904031465ae5d13981f54b5560e787ebc898b46b3c062f70df209fffaff0b8`;
  coverage remains **2043/2103** and **2132/2185**, with zero selector,
  metric, selected-hash, or runtime-validation change. The core machine
  emitter falls from **48,352 to 47,195 lines**; the numeric module is
  **1,768 lines** with **23 static top-level helpers**, and the narrow
  function-only internal contract is **52 lines**. The module export audit
  reports only `mir_try_emit_numeric_kernels [T]`, no read-only or writable
  data, and **PASS**; canonical and CMake builds pass.
- The same module admits the 11-block `primes.main`
  `final-cost-policy` fallback through a strict name-free matcher over all
  **120 MIR instructions**. It proves the `argc`/`argv[1]` ABI, `atol`
  conversion, unsigned start and odd normalization, the unsigned square-root
  helper relationship, outer ten-result loop, 32-bit odd divisor/modulo loop,
  `%lu` variadic print target in both automatic-long and forced-float/long
  modes, and final zero return. The emitter uses an 11-byte IX frame, keeps
  the active divisor low word in BC across `__lmu`, carries its high word
  explicitly, preserves full 32-bit wrap and the source's boundary behavior,
  and uses no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics are
  **1,616/3,574 bytes** and **145/352 instructions**; stack-check metrics are
  **1,645/3,603** and **146/353**. Checked-setting selected versus forced
  fallback improves peep from **4,619,721 to 3,929,138 cycles**
  (**-690,583 / -14.95%**) and **7,040 to 6,656 bytes**, and nopeep from
  **4,635,343 to 3,929,149 cycles** (**-706,194 / -15.23%**) with the same
  384-byte reduction. A renamed-helper edge A/B covers starts
  `0, 1, 2, 65534, 65535, 4294967294`; selected and fallback output is
  byte-identical in peep and nopeep. At 65,534, selected/fallback is
  **6,626,136/8,023,323 cycles peep** and
  **6,626,175/8,049,751 nopeep**, with **6,656/7,040 bytes** in both modes.
  Full `primes`, `tshlmac`, and `tdmfuse` peep/nopeep validation passes with
  zero checked regression and no baseline update. Normal coverage advances
  **2043/2103 (97.15%)** to **2044/2103 (97.19%)**; stack-check advances
  **2132/2185 (97.57%)** to **2133/2185 (97.62%)**, adding exactly
  `primes.main`, removing none, moving selector counts from
  **1,421 spilled / 357 scheduled** to **1,420 spilled / 358 scheduled**,
  and leaving **52 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. Final proof-snapshot
  SHA-256 values are
  `dc7f360093250818c911b29511dd5ffeec40f4102ed92edab75571d42481c0e0`
  normal and
  `60062d11a5a604ad5daa0925f9b88bdcd2adc1abbbb01cb4f93f538e23c9d195`
  stack-check.
- The first machine-emitter architecture pivot moves the recently added float
  report/check orchestration family, including the raw-conversion checker,
  from `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c` into
  `dcc_mir_machine_float_reports.c`. The new module owns the plan structs,
  strict matchers, emitters, raw-before-float production dispatch, and both
  family-local strict-smaller gates. A narrow
  `dcc_mir_machine_internal.h` contract exposes only the shared machine
  matching/emission functions it needs; the extraction adds **zero shared
  variables**, and all plan/candidate state remains module-local. The module
  has 35 `static` helpers and exports only its single dispatch entry.
  `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c` falls from
  **54,347 to 52,387 lines**; the new family module is **1,975 lines** and its
  internal contract is **27 lines**. The normal and stack-check full censuses
  are byte-identical before/after: **0** coverage, selector, metric, selected
  hash, or runtime-validation changes; stack coverage remains
  **2126/2185 (97.30%)**. All 11 affected apps pass full peep/nopeep validation
  with no checked performance regression and no baseline update.
- The second machine-emitter architecture pivot starts from `8ff8f65` and
  extracts the complete strict attention-kernel family
  (`transposed_matrix_vector_multiply`, `add_outer_product`, `softmax`,
  `matrix_vector_add`, and `backward_pass`) into
  `dcc_mir_machine_attention.c`. The new **2,637-line** module owns all three
  plans, strict matchers, emitters, family helpers, selector order, and its
  single dispatch entry; it has 44 `static` helpers and `nm` reports only
  `mir_try_emit_attention_kernels` as a defined global symbol, with no writable
  storage symbol. `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c` falls from **52,387 to 49,780
  lines**. The function-only internal contract grows from **27 to 36 lines**:
  four indispensable shared helper prototypes (parameter offset, pointee
  volatility, global-address resolution, and global-address DE emission) plus
  the one family dispatch prototype, and no global declaration.
  Normal **2037/2102 (96.91%)** and stack-check **2126/2185 (97.30%)**
  censuses are byte-identical before/after under `--fail-on-regression`, so all
  selector order, labels, metrics, selected hashes, and runtime-validation
  sets are unchanged. Canonical and CMake builds pass, and `attnc11` passes
  full peep/nopeep correctness and checked performance with no baseline update.
- The third machine-emitter architecture pivot starts from `b708c28` and
  extracts the landed comment and whitespace scanners, interpreter action
  decoder, buffered declaration parser, and bounded symbol search into
  `dcc_mir_machine_scanners.c`. The new **2,294-line** module owns all five
  plans, matchers, emitters, and 31 `static` family helpers; its two-phase
  `mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels` dispatch keeps the first four selectors before
  attention and the symbol search after float reports, exactly preserving the
  production order. `nm` reports only that dispatch as defined global code,
  with no read-only or writable data symbol. `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c` falls
  from **49,780 to 47,689 lines**. The function-only internal contract grows
  from **36 to 46 lines** with five indispensable shared helper prototypes
  (pointer/word type matching, local-buffer matching, HL offset emission, and
  global-word store emission) plus the dispatch prototype; there is no global
  declaration or shared mutable state. Normal **2037/2102 (96.91%)** and
  stack-check **2126/2185 (97.30%)** censuses are byte-identical before/after,
  including labels, metrics, selectors, selected hashes, and validation sets
  (SHA-256 `0e98c2f843d5fa45bbc29b0ed274e4e119956e3ea6b44e1a59854622b397a7c5`
  and `30f5edd85cc3a04332d8e8a95b20159ffd4760233f4988f8ba7ba43cae66c48a`).
  Canonical and CMake builds pass; `fint`, `cint`, `bint`, and `forint` pass
  full peep/nopeep validation with zero checked regression and no baseline
  update.
- The next coverage batch admits the 10-block deferred
  `tdmfuse.test_while_register_narrowed` fallback through a strict, name-free
  scheduled matcher in the core machine emitter. It proves the complete
  165-instruction graph, signed 16-bit count/value/index state, unsigned-byte
  narrowed loop and array state, nonvolatile/nonoverlapping local ranges,
  div/mod operand identity, all stores, the three-argument check call and
  seven-iteration outer bound. The emitter retains the real 32-byte frame and
  both loops, keeps the inner narrowed counter in BC across `__sdivmod` with
  explicit save/restore, uses DE for the report index only across safe spans,
  and never uses IY. The family remains in the core for now because it is a
  numeric div/mod trace loop, not a scanner/parser family.
  Normal metrics improve from **2,457/223 captured bytes/instructions to
  1,138/104 selected**; stack-check metrics improve from **2,486/224 to
  1,167/105**. Focused full mode passes with selected results of
  **172,199 cycles / 8,960 bytes peep** and
  **175,887 cycles / 8,832 bytes nopeep**. Forced fallback is
  **187,705 / 9,088** and **202,264 / 9,088**, so the exact A/B gain is
  **-15,506 cycles (-8.26%) / -128 bytes** peep and
  **-26,377 cycles (-13.04%) / -256 bytes** nopeep.
  A scratch boundary/wrap variant replaces the scale with 32,767 and produces
  the independently computed signed-wrap trace
  `12052,-1139,11879,16082,-16261,15579,2596`; selected and forced-fallback
  program output is byte-identical in peep and nopeep. Its selected/fallback
  measurements are **506,581/531,921 cycles** peep and
  **510,390/546,517 cycles** nopeep, with **5,632/5,888 bytes** in both
  modes. The regression-gated stack census against
  `/tmp/mir-census-current.tsv` advances **2,126/2,185 (97.30%)** to
  **2,127/2,185 (97.35%)**, leaves **58 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks, and
  changes exactly this one function/app with zero removal. No baseline changes.
- The next scanner-family coverage batch admits the 13-block bounded
  four-character string predicate in `cint`. The strict matcher proves all
  **74 MIR instructions**, the single nonvolatile signed-character pointer
  parameter, five ordered byte loads at offsets 0 through 4, the four
  short-circuit boolean joins, exact equality types, four nonzero
  seven-bit character constants, the final zero terminator, and the final
  `int` 0/1 return. It captures the compared bytes from MIR and contains no
  source-function or application-name test. The frameless emitter loads the
  pointer from SP, performs only the source-ordered reads, stops at the first
  mismatch, leaves null-pointer behavior unchanged rather than adding a
  special case, and uses no IY. Normal selected/captured metrics improve from
  **1,285/121 bytes/instructions to 274/28**; stack-check metrics improve from
  **1,314/122 to 303/29**.
  `cint` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus forced fallback is
  **299,200,769/299,201,203 cycles** with **31,360/31,360 bytes** peep and
  **305,243,211/305,244,627 cycles** with **35,840/36,096 bytes** nopeep:
  **-434 cycles (-0.00015%) / 0 bytes** and
  **-1,416 cycles (-0.00046%) / -256 bytes (-0.71%)** respectively.
  A scratch selected/fallback edge harness covers the exact string, empty and
  one-to-three-character prefixes, a longer suffix, every case-position
  mismatch, minimally sized arrays that fail at offsets 0 through 3, an exact
  five-byte array, and a null pointer; all four runs print identical 0/1
  results and return success. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **64,885/67,299 cycles** with **2,432/2,432 bytes** peep and
  **65,012/72,464 cycles** with **2,432/2,688 bytes** nopeep.
  The scanner module audit now reports **2,502 source lines**, **35 static
  top-level helpers**, only `mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels` as exported code,
  and zero read-only or writable data exports. The regression-gated
  stack-check census advances **2,127/2,185 (97.35%)** to
  **2,128/2,185 (97.39%)**, changes only this function/application, removes no
  accepted function, moves selector counts from **1,426 spilled / 352
  scheduled** to **1,425 spilled / 353 scheduled**, and leaves
  **57 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No baseline changes.
- The next scanner-family batch admits the 12-block two-character delimiter
  scan in `pint`. The strict name-free matcher proves all **86 MIR
  instructions**, four distinct nonvolatile globals (source pointer, signed
  long length/cursor, and signed line counter), both signed-long
  `cursor + 1 < length` bounds, the ordered `'*'`/`')'` reads, newline count,
  every cursor store, the final two-byte advance, and the complete
  short-circuit CFG. The emitter keeps the source cursor in BC, uses a fast
  registerized 16-bit bounded path only when both long high words are zero,
  retains an exact signed 32-bit path for every other value, never reads the
  second delimiter byte before the bound succeeds, and uses no IY. A
  mode-aware unreachable tail preserves the established downstream code
  addresses: push/pop pairs disappear under dccpeep while the retained NOP
  bytes make the peep and nopeep function endpoints independently identical
  to fallback.
  Normal selected/captured metrics improve from **3,082/314
  bytes/instructions to 2,945/309**; stack-check metrics improve from
  **3,111/315 to 2,974/310**. `pint` passes full peep/nopeep selected and
  forced-fallback runs with identical checked measurements:
  **253,436,043/284,125,051 cycles** and **30,464/33,024 bytes**.
  A scratch selected/fallback edge harness covers immediate and delayed
  closure, newline counting, two unterminated bodies, exact two- and
  three-byte EOF bounds, empty input, and negative length. All four runs print
  identical cursor/line results. Selected/fallback measurements are
  **100,153/116,197 cycles and 2,944/3,072 bytes** peep
  (**-16,044, -13.81%; -128 bytes, -4.17%**) and
  **101,106/120,088 cycles and 3,072/3,200 bytes** nopeep
  (**-18,982, -15.81%; -128 bytes, -4.00%**).
  The scanner module audit reports **3,059 source lines**, **48 static
  top-level helpers**, only `mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels` as exported code,
  and zero read-only or writable data exports. The regression-gated
  stack-check census advances **2,128/2,185 (97.39%)** to
  **2,129/2,185 (97.44%)**, changes only this function/application, removes no
  accepted function, moves selector counts from **1,425 spilled / 353
  scheduled** to **1,424 spilled / 354 scheduled**, and leaves
  **56 `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No baseline, name, or hash gate was
  added.
- The next float-family coverage batch admits the nine-block arithmetic
  normalization/decomposition loop in `tlog.frexpf` through a strict
  name-free matcher in `dcc_mir_machine_float_reports.c`. It proves the exact
  **72-instruction** graph, float and `int *` parameter ABI, initial exponent
  zero store, signed zero/negative comparisons, recursive sign normalization,
  both value-scaling loops, every exponent pointer update, self-call
  identity/prototype, parameter locations, and all returns. The emitter
  retains the established `__feqf`/`__fgtf`/`__flef`/`__fmf` fastcall
  convention, mutates only the by-value parameter copy, reloads the exponent
  pointer for every observable write, preserves carry/borrow wrapping, uses
  IX for stable parameter access, and uses no IY. Its family-local
  strict-smaller gate remains in force; the final generic cost policy is
  unchanged. Normal selected/captured metrics are **1,562/1,615 bytes** and
  **141/145 instructions**; stack-check metrics are **1,591/1,644** and
  **142/146**. `tlog` passes full peep/nopeep validation. Selected versus
  forced fallback is **1,046,252/1,046,294 cycles** peep and
  **1,047,767/1,048,350 cycles** nopeep, exact gains of **-42 (-0.0040%)**
  and **-583 (-0.0556%)**; linked size is unchanged at **8,448 bytes** in
  both modes.
  A separately named boundary/alias clone exercises positive and negative
  zero, both normalization boundaries, large and small powers, negative
  recursion, a NaN, and exponent pointers aliasing both words of the caller's
  source float. Selected and forced-fallback output is byte-identical in peep
  and nopeep; selected/fallback measurements are **707,338/707,428 cycles**
  peep and **707,982/708,903 cycles** nopeep, all at **5,888 bytes**.
  The float module audit reports **2,339 source lines**, **40 static top-level
  helpers**, only `mir_try_emit_float_reports` as exported code, and zero
  read-only or writable data exports. The regression-gated stack census
  advances **2,129/2,185 (97.44%)** to **2,130/2,185 (97.48%)**, changes
  only `tlog`, adds exactly `tlog.frexpf`, removes no accepted function, moves
  selector counts to **1,423 spilled / 355 scheduled**, and leaves **55
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. The prior forced final-generic
  `tlog.logf` experiment remains a measured regression and stays behind the
  unchanged cost gate. No performance baseline changed.
- The next aggregate/multidimensional batch admits both seven-block
  `too.test_multidim` and `too.test_size_inference2` through one strict,
  name-free scheduled family. The two variants prove the complete
  144/401-instruction graphs, all 14/24 calls, every checker/helper
  relationship, inferred row/element counts, 12/3 and 12/6 multidimensional
  strides, all local initializer and loop stores, fixed local/global member
  addresses, and the original void returns. The emitters retain compact
  13-byte and 86-byte IX frames, use no IY, preserve the pointer alias and all
  check/report ordering, and keep every observed aggregate value in its
  original width. Normal selected/captured metrics are **2,402/2,521 bytes
  and 226/237 instructions** for `test_multidim`, and **5,981/7,109 bytes
  and 554/661 instructions** for `test_size_inference2`; stack-check metrics
  are **2,431/2,550 and 227/238**, and **6,010/7,138 and 555/662**.
  `too` passes full peep/nopeep. Selected versus one-function forced fallback
  improves `test_multidim` by **210 cycles peep** and **244 cycles nopeep**
  with equal linked sizes, and improves `test_size_inference2` by
  **9,176 cycles / 128 bytes peep** and **6,203 cycles / 256 bytes nopeep**.
  A separately renamed edge clone raises board weights to a 120,018-wide sum
  and local inferred-array values to 30,000..30,003; selected and fallback
  program output is byte-identical in both modes. Its per-function A/B is
  **1,885,183/1,885,393 cycles and 19,200/19,200 bytes peep** plus
  **1,902,066/1,902,379 and 20,224/20,224 nopeep** for the multidimensional
  variant, and **1,885,183/1,894,359 cycles and 19,200/19,328 bytes peep**
  plus **1,902,066/1,908,269 and 20,224/20,480 nopeep** for size inference.
  The regression-gated stack census advances **2,130/2,185 (97.48%)** to
  **2,132/2,185 (97.57%)**, adds exactly these two functions, removes none,
  moves selector counts from **1,423 spilled / 355 scheduled** to
  **1,421 spilled / 357 scheduled**, and leaves **53
  `final-cost-policy`** fallbacks. No production name, output hash, or
  baseline gate was added.
- The aggregate batch is now placed in its own compiled
  `dcc_mir_machine_aggregate_checks.c` family module rather than growing the
  core emitter. The module owns both plan variants, every table, matcher,
  emitter, and private helper; the plan is local to
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks`, which is the module's only exported symbol.
  The dispatch remains exactly between `local-array-struct-checks` and
  `alias-mix`, preserving selector order. No adjacent established schedule was
  moved: those two neighbours have distinct plans and emission contracts, so
  moving either would expand the refactor's proof surface without improving
  family cohesion; in particular, `local-array-struct-checks` is coupled to
  the core `MirMachineForm` pointer/alias matcher stack rather than being a
  self-contained aggregate-check schedule. The pending implementation's
  `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c` falls from **49,695 to 48,352 lines** (**-1,343**);
  the new module is **1,567 lines** with **27 static top-level helpers**.
  `dcc_mir_machine_internal.h` is **49 lines** and adds only the family dispatch
  prototype; it declares no shared data. The export audit reports only
  `mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks [T]`, with no read-only or writable data.
  Canonical and CMake builds pass. Normal before/after censuses are
  byte-identical at SHA-256
  `93168b31174f680dafd4a427709d179f5dbc4f5e0a0da871d240b5c058f1dcd0`
  (**2043/2103, 97.15%**), and stack-check censuses are byte-identical at
  `ea904031465ae5d13981f54b5560e787ebc898b46b3c062f70df209fffaff0b8`
  (**2132/2185, 97.57%**): zero selector, metric, selected-hash, coverage, or
  validation-set changes. `too` full passes peep/nopeep with zero regression;
  selected totals remain **1,865,062 cycles / 21,888 bytes peep** and
  **1,882,005 / 22,912 nopeep**.
- Architecture rule for subsequent machine-family extractions: add **zero
  shared variables or mutable state**. Each module owns its plan structs,
  static arrays/constants, counters, candidate state, matchers, emitters, and
  selector ordering locally; it exports only one family dispatch entry, and
  `dcc_mir_machine_internal.h` remains a function-prototype-only contract.
  New schedules must be added directly to their cohesive family module; do not
  regrow `dcc_mir_machine_emit.c`. Use the core only when no established family
  fits, and extract a new family as soon as the schedule has a cohesive peer.
- `scripts/audit-c-module-exports.py` makes that rule repeatable: it compiles
  each module with the repository host C11/include settings, runs
  `nm -g --defined-only` (GNU nm or llvm-nm), reports LOC, best-effort static
  top-level functions, and exported code/read-only/writable data, then fails on
  writable storage or any function not explicitly allowlisted. Audit the two
  current extractions from any working directory with:
  ```sh
  python3 scripts/audit-c-module-exports.py \
    src/dcc/dcc_mir_machine_float_reports.c \
    --allow-function mir_try_emit_float_reports
  python3 scripts/audit-c-module-exports.py \
    src/dcc/dcc_mir_machine_attention.c \
    --allow-function mir_try_emit_attention_kernels
  python3 scripts/audit-c-module-exports.py \
    src/dcc/dcc_mir_machine_scanners.c \
    --allow-function mir_try_emit_scanner_kernels
  python3 scripts/audit-c-module-exports.py \
    src/dcc/dcc_mir_machine_aggregate_checks.c \
    --allow-function mir_try_emit_aggregate_checks
  ```
- Two strict name-free scheduled families admit the genuine nine-block
  call/check/report mains in `tfmaddr` and `tfpraw`. The float report family
  now accepts the fully proved nine-check, 195-instruction, 41-call,
  single-checker/no-local profile used by `tfmaddr.main`; the emitted and
  captured 42-call assembly sequences are identical. A new raw-conversion
  checker family accounts for all 519 instructions and 82 MIR calls in
  `tfpraw.main`: four distinct one-wide-argument predicate groups with
  6/7/6/7 uses, 26 boolean checks, two distinct seven-use conversion groups,
  14 wide checks through one reused union location, and the canonical
  check/failure summary, PASS/FAIL selection, and nonzero return. It emits
  each proved int/long-to-float conversion through the original `__fif` or
  `__flf` helper before the matching wrapper/check call. Its selected and
  captured 97-call assembly sequences are identical. Both families use no IY
  and retain a family-local strict-smaller gate. Ordinary selected/captured
  metrics are 4,189/4,331 bytes and 434/447 instructions for `tfmaddr`, and
  7,085/11,101 bytes and 729/1,152 instructions for `tfpraw`; stack-check
  metrics are 4,218/4,360 and 435/448, and 7,114/11,130 and 730/1,153.
  Full peep/nopeep validation passes. Selected versus forced-main-fallback
  results are `tfmaddr` 81,247/81,247 peep cycles and 81,247/81,373 nopeep,
  with 6,912/6,912 and 6,912/7,040 bytes; and `tfpraw` 81,057/84,309 and
  81,561/84,874 cycles, with 7,424/7,936 and 7,424/8,064 bytes. Deliberate
  one-check mismatch harnesses produce byte-identical failure text, summary,
  `RESULT: FAIL`, and nonzero return in selected/fallback peep and nopeep
  runs. No baseline changed. Forced final spilled output remains a real loss
  for the other fresh nine-block residuals: `tstrconv.main` regresses both
  modes by 0.25-0.43% and 512-640 bytes, while `tlog.frexpf` regresses
  3.11-3.29% and 384 bytes. They remain on fallback. The regression-gated
  stack census advances from 2124/2185 to 2126/2185 with exactly
  `tfmaddr.main` and `tfpraw.main`, and no removal.
- Three strict variants of the float call/report family now admit the remaining
  nine-block mains in `tasinfsp`, `tfmodfsp`, and `tfmaf`. They retain the
  complete existing recursive expression proof and add exact structural
  profiles for 177/396/289 MIR instructions, 12/27/15 checker calls,
  36/86/61 total calls, and checker-use distributions 10+2, 8+4+15, and
  14+1. The variant emitter evaluates each proven call argument in the
  established reverse ABI order; the complete selected and captured main call
  sequences are identical in all three applications. Float unary constants
  fold their sign bit at emission, while every float runtime, checker, bitcast,
  FMA, modulo, and printf call remains present and ordered. `tasinfsp` uses one
  four-byte IX NaN snapshot, `tfmodfsp` uses one four-byte IX NaN snapshot and
  rematerializes its proven infinity constants, and `tfmaf` is frameless. No IY
  is used. The family-local strict-smaller gate remains in force.
  Non-stack selected/captured metrics are respectively 3,445/3,460 bytes and
  340/346 instructions; 8,483/8,802 and 881/909; and 6,407/6,557 and 667/680.
  Stack-check metrics are 3,474/3,489 and 341/347; 8,512/8,831 and 882/910;
  and 6,436/6,586 and 668/681. Affected full peep/nopeep validation passes with
  no checked regression. Selected versus forced-main-fallback results are:
  `tasinfsp` 131,380/131,380 peep cycles and 131,379/131,437 nopeep, with
  7,808/7,808 and 7,808/7,936 bytes; `tfmodfsp` 448,571/449,118 and
  449,706/450,308 cycles, with 10,368/10,368 and 10,368/10,496 bytes; and
  `tfmaf` 104,794/104,794 and 104,794/104,920 cycles, with 7,680/7,680 and
  7,680/7,808 bytes. Separately named failure harnesses retain the same
  nine-block structures while deliberately mismatching one asin value, one
  modulo bit result, and one FMA bit result. Selected and fallback program
  output is identical in both modes, including each failure line, summary,
  `RESULT: FAIL`, and nonzero return. Selected/fallback failure-harness
  peep/nopeep cycles are 213,080/213,092 and 213,084/213,164; 490,773/491,332
  and 491,898/492,522; and 145,414/145,414 and 145,414/145,562. Linked sizes
  are equal in peep; selected nopeep is equal for asin and 128 bytes smaller
  for modulo and FMA. No performance baseline changed. The regression-gated
  stack census advances from 2121/2185 to 2124/2185 with exactly these three
  additions and no removal.
- One shared strict name-free float call/report scheduler now admits the
  nine-block `main` graphs in `tlogfsp`, `tfloorsp`, `tatan2sp`, and
  `tfpspec`; it also replaces the larger active spilled schedules in
  `tfdf.main` and `tsqrtsp.main`. The matcher requires at least 14 ordered
  checks, 38 direct calls, exactly two repeated three-argument checker
  identities, one captured nonvolatile float snapshot, the canonical two
  variadic summary/result prints, distinct global check/failure counters,
  and the exact final failure-to-boolean control flow. It recursively proves
  every constant, snapshot, local pointer output, unary/binary float
  operation, direct call prototype/target, argument definition/index, and
  checker width; every instruction before the final report is accounted for.
  Emission schedules effectful arguments in MIR order, rematerializes only
  proven values, retains all float runtime/check/print calls, and uses a
  four-byte IX snapshot frame except for `tfloorsp`'s compact 12-byte
  snapshot/`modff` output frame. No IY is used. A final family-local cost gate
  requires the complete emitted assembly stream to be strictly smaller than
  the captured stream. This keeps `tasinfsp.main`, `tfmodfsp.main`, and
  `tfmaf.main` on fallback after forced A/B exposed real cycle/sector losses.
  The six retained apps pass full peep/nopeep and forced-main-fallback A/B
  with identical output and no checked regression. A separately named
  30-check infinity/NaN/signed-zero harness selects at 8,948/9,696 bytes and
  exercises the failure print/nonzero return; selected and fallback output
  are identical in both modes, while selected improves 341,694 to 339,981
  peep cycles and 341,762 to 339,984 nopeep cycles, with linked size
  8,576 to 8,320 bytes in both modes. The regression-gated stack census
  advances from 2117/2185 to 2121/2185 with exactly four additions and no
  removal.
- A strict name-free conversion-check scheduler now admits the exact
  482-instruction, eight-block `tatof.main` graph. The matcher validates all
  46 checks in source order: 26 float comparisons, three float-to-int
  conversions, nine end-pointer checks, five infinity checks, and three NaN
  checks. It proves all 37 one-pointer float conversion calls, the three
  signed float-to-int ABI conversions, all three float multiplications, every
  typed float/word constant, all 94 string operands, every call-site argument
  index and definition, each checker prototype and repeated symbol identity,
  both variadic print branches, the distinct global check/failure counters,
  and the final reloaded failure-to-boolean return. Selection uses only the
  complete MIR structure, types, prototypes, storage relationships, and CFG;
  no source/app/function name or output hash is consulted. Emission is
  frameless, uses no IY, retains the DE:HL float ABI and the established
  `__fmf`/`__ffi` conversions, preserves all conversion/check/print calls and
  their ordering, and keeps the original success/failure paths. Non-stack
  selected/captured metrics are 8,039/8,775 bytes and 810/922 instructions;
  stack-check metrics are 8,068/8,804 bytes and 811/923 instructions.
  `tatof` passes full peep/nopeep. Checked performance improves peep from
  1,847,963 to 1,841,506 cycles (-6,457 / -0.35%) and 9,600 to 9,344 bytes
  (-256 / -2.67%), and nopeep from 1,852,891 to 1,843,460 cycles
  (-9,431 / -0.51%) and 9,984 to 9,344 bytes (-640 / -6.41%). A separately
  renamed conversion-edge harness selects at 8,075/8,811 bytes and 811/923
  instructions while checking 32,767, -32,767, and a scaled 16,383.5-to-32,767
  conversion. Selected and forced-fallback output is identical in both modes.
  Peep improves from 1,878,263 to 1,877,132 cycles with equal 8,704-byte linked
  size; nopeep improves from 1,880,291 to 1,879,086 cycles and 8,832 to
  8,704 bytes. A deliberate one-check mismatch exercises the failure print and
  nonzero return path; selected and forced-fallback program output is identical
  in peep and nopeep modes (`got 32767 expected 32766`, then `tatof FAILED 1`).
  No performance baseline changes were made. The regression-gated stack-check
  census advances from 2116/2185 to 2117/2185 with exactly `tatof.main` and no
  removal.
- A strict name-free formatted-buffer scheduler now admits the exact
  897-instruction, eight-block `tzpad.main` graph. The matcher proves the
  single 64-byte local character array and every one of its 122 address
  uses, all 61 alternating three-argument variadic formatting calls and
  three-pointer checker calls, all 185 string operands, all integer and long
  constant widths/bits, each call-site argument index and definition, each
  per-format runtime hook and assembly target, and both final variadic print
  branches plus the reloaded global failure return. Formatting, checker, and
  print callees are selected only by prototype, definition status, and
  repeated symbol relationships; no source function or application name is
  consulted. The emitter keeps the compact 64-byte buffer directly below IX,
  carries its address in DE between calls by restoring the already-pushed
  first argument, preserves the wide variadic stack order and hex/octal hooks,
  and uses no IY. Non-stack selected/captured metrics are 11,729/15,241 bytes
  and 1,207/1,459 instructions; stack-check metrics are 11,758/15,270 bytes
  and 1,208/1,460 instructions. `tzpad` passes full peep/nopeep. The checked
  performance gate improves peep from 447,775 to 443,108 cycles
  (-4,667 / -1.04%) and 9,344 to 8,704 bytes (-640 / -6.85%), and nopeep from
  447,708 to 442,984 cycles (-4,724 / -1.06%) and 9,472 to 8,704 bytes
  (-768 / -8.11%). A separately renamed buffer-edge harness selects the same
  graph while formatting 63 characters plus the terminator into the complete
  64-byte buffer. Selected and forced-fallback program output is identical in
  both modes; peep improves from 460,831 to 456,164 cycles and 6,784 to 6,016
  bytes, while nopeep improves from 460,764 to 456,040 cycles and 6,784 to
  6,144 bytes. No name, hash, performance baseline, or IY allocation
  participates in selection. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  from 2115/2185 to 2116/2185 with exactly `tzpad.main` and no removal.
- A strict name-free unsigned-long binary-search scheduler now admits the
  72-instruction, eight-block `primes.ulsqrt` graph. The matcher validates the
  single unsigned 32-bit parameter and stack position, all four local
  identities, `low = 1`, `high = n / 2`, `result = 0`, the `n <= 1` return,
  the unsigned `low <= high` loop, the exact overflow-safe midpoint
  `low + ((high - low) / 2)`, the ordered `n / mid` quotient test, both
  `mid +/- 1` updates, and the final 32-bit return. The emitter uses a compact
  12-byte IX frame for only low, high, and result; midpoint remains in DE:HL
  and a transient stack save instead of retaining the fourth source local.
  Division by two is emitted as a logical 32-bit shift. The variable division
  preserves the `__ldu` fastcall ABI exactly: the dividend is pushed and the
  divisor arrives in DE:HL, with midpoint kept below the pushed dividend for
  the subsequent update. Unsigned comparisons run most-significant byte first,
  and all midpoint/update arithmetic propagates the original 32-bit
  carry/borrow behavior. No IY is used. Non-stack selected/captured metrics are
  1,652/2,596 bytes and 146/243 instructions; stack-check metrics are
  1,681/2,625 bytes and 147/244 instructions. `primes` passes full peep/nopeep.
  Against forcing only this function back, cycles improve from 6,292,774 to
  4,619,721 peep (-1,673,053 / -26.59%) and from 6,347,782 to 4,635,343
  nopeep (-1,712,439 / -26.98%); linked size falls from 7,168 to 7,040 bytes
  in both modes (-128 / -1.79%). A separately renamed boundary harness selects
  with the same stack-check metrics and produces identical selected/fallback
  program output in peep and nopeep modes for 0, 1, small exact/non-exact
  squares, the 16-bit transition, signed-boundary bit patterns, and values
  through `UINT32_MAX`; every checked result is correct, including 65,535 for
  the maximum input. The harness improves from 4,680,157 to 3,678,926 peep
  cycles (-1,001,231 / -21.39%) and from 4,705,739 to 3,684,533 nopeep cycles
  (-1,021,206 / -21.70%); linked sizes fall 3,840 to 3,712 bytes peep and
  4,096 to 3,840 bytes nopeep. No app/function name, hash, performance
  baseline, or IY allocation participates in selection. The regression-gated
  stack-check census advances from 2114/2185 to 2115/2185 with exactly this
  function and no removal.
- The strict name-free backward-orchestration scheduler now admits the
  730-instruction, 37-block `attnc11.backward_pass` graph. Its exact structural
  gate validates the full opcode/control-flow sequence, all 101 typed
  constants, all global-location alias relationships, every two-byte indexed
  stride, all 24 direct calls and argument-definition order, each helper
  prototype/long-value ABI, and every loop branch, backedge, and PHI. The
  emitter composes the already-landed softmax, matrix multiply/add, transposed
  multiply, outer-product, dot-product, scaled-add, Q16 conversion, shift, and
  clamp helpers instead of reproducing their arithmetic. It preserves the six
  backward stages and every gradient update in source order, including the
  in-place score-gradient rewrite, the distinct row-dot checkpoint across its
  inner loop, and the second embedding-gradient reload after the token-gradient
  store. A six-byte IX frame holds only counters and scalar checkpoints; no IY
  is used. Non-stack selected/captured metrics are 9,802/12,121 bytes and
  942/1,069 instructions; stack-check metrics are 9,831/12,150 bytes and
  943/1,070 instructions. `attnc11` passes full peep/nopeep. Against forcing
  only this function back, cycles remain exactly 339,250,960 peep /
  342,162,991 nopeep, while linked size falls from 23,680 to 23,424 bytes peep
  (-256) and from 25,344 to 24,960 bytes nopeep (-384). A separately renamed
  edge harness selects with the same stack-check metrics and produces
  byte-identical selected/forced-fallback program output for signed extrema,
  boundary target indices, in-place softmax and score updates, sequential
  token/position accumulation, and all six gradient stages. It improves from
  46,649,233 to 46,625,765 peep cycles (-23,468 / -0.0503%) and from
  47,232,446 to 47,136,389 nopeep cycles (-96,057 / -0.2034%); linked sizes
  fall 19,200 to 18,944 bytes peep and 20,736 to 20,352 bytes nopeep. No
  app/function name, hash, performance-baseline change, or IY allocation
  participates in selection. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  from 2113/2185 to 2114/2185 with exactly this function and no removal.
- The shared strict name-free matrix-product scheduler now also admits the
  141-instruction, 19-block `attnc11.matrix_vector_add` graph. The new variant
  proves all five parameter types and stack positions, unsigned byte row and
  column dimensions, both loops and PHIs, two-byte matrix postincrement and
  indexed input stride, each ordered signed 16x16-to-32 multiplication and
  signed 32-bit accumulation, the complete saturating Q16-to-Q8 conversion
  CFG, output postincrement before destination reload, the final signed
  wide addition, clamp call, and indirect store. Emission follows the existing
  attention-kernel cursor policy: IX advances through the matrix, DE resets to
  the input base for each row and advances only after each read, and BC carries
  both unsigned loop counts across the multiply and clamp boundaries. A
  four-byte stack accumulator is the only frame storage; no IY is used.
  Matrix is read before input on every product, the output cursor store remains
  before its destination load, and output is written only after a complete row,
  preserving matrix/input/output overlap behavior. Non-stack selected/captured
  metrics are 1,861/2,893 bytes and 195/278 instructions; stack-check metrics
  are 1,890/2,922 bytes and 196/279 instructions. `attnc11` passes full
  peep/nopeep. Against forcing only this function back, cycles remain exactly
  339,250,960 peep / 342,162,991 nopeep, while linked size falls from 23,808
  to 23,680 bytes peep (-128) and 25,600 to 25,344 bytes nopeep (-256).
  A separately named alias harness selects with the same stack-check metrics
  and produces identical selected/forced-fallback output in peep and nopeep
  modes for ordinary, zero-row, zero-column, Q16 saturation, negative
  truncation, final-add saturation, matrix/input, output/input,
  output/future-matrix, and all-three alias cases. It improves from 342,428 to
  327,826 peep cycles (-14,602 / -4.26%) and from 354,745 to 334,952 nopeep
  cycles (-19,793 / -5.58%); linked sizes fall 3,968 to 3,840 bytes peep and
  4,224 to 3,968 bytes nopeep. No app/function name, hash, performance
  baseline, or IY allocation participates in selection. The regression-gated
  stack-check census advances from 2112/2185 to 2113/2185 with exactly this
  function and no removal.
- One strict name-free softmax scheduler now admits `attnc11.softmax`. The
  matcher validates the complete 132-instruction, nine-block graph: the
  pointer/unsigned-byte parameters and stack positions, the initial
  three-argument maximum scan and its distinct dummy output, the first
  bounded traversal, signed wrapped maximum difference and negative clamp,
  three-bit shift and 255 cap, ordered lookup/store/reload accumulation, the
  second bounded traversal, signed long Q8 numerator construction and
  division, the one-argument clamp call, and both pointer/index increments.
  Emission preserves every call and source evaluation point, including table
  loads after the current item read and stores before accumulation, so a
  vector overlapping the lookup table remains ordered safely. Each traversal
  keeps its cursor in DE and its unsigned remaining count in B; the complete
  frame is six bytes for the distinct dummy, maximum, and sum words. No IY is
  used. Non-stack selected/captured metrics are 1,290/2,323 bytes and 131/208
  instructions; stack-check metrics are 1,319/2,352 bytes and 132/209
  instructions. `attnc11` passes full peep/nopeep. Against forcing only this
  function back, cycles remain exactly 339,250,960 peep / 342,162,991
  nopeep, while linked sizes improve from 23,936 to 23,808 bytes peep and
  from 25,728 to 25,600 bytes nopeep (-128 each). A separately named harness
  selects at 1,278/2,304 bytes and 131/208 instructions and produces
  byte-identical program output in selected peep/nopeep and forced-fallback
  peep/nopeep modes for ordinary, zero-length, one-element, lookup-cap,
  signed-overflow, lookup-table alias, and 255-element cases. The harness
  improves from 2,574,317 to 2,378,680 peep cycles (-7.60%) and from
  3,083,359 to 2,808,535 nopeep cycles (-8.91%); linked sizes fall
  4,736 to 4,608 bytes and 5,120 to 4,864 bytes. No app/function name, hash,
  performance-baseline change, or IY allocation participates in selection.
  The regression-gated stack-check census advances from 2111/2185 to
  2112/2185 with exactly this function and no removal.
- One strict name-free matrix-product scheduler now admits
  `attnc11.transposed_matrix_vector_multiply` and
  `attnc11.add_outer_product`. The shared matcher validates each complete
  seven-block graph, all five parameter types and stack positions, unsigned
  byte bounds, both loop/control edges, two-byte matrix/vector strides,
  source-pointer postincrements, per-product signed 16x16-to-32 multiply,
  Q8 conversion call, signed 32-bit accumulation, clamp call, and final
  two-byte store. Its two structural variants preserve the source order:
  transposed multiply advances and reads the matrix before reading the indexed
  output, while outer product reads the indexed right operand before advancing
  and reading the matrix destination. The emitter uses the established
  `__m1s`, Q8-conversion, clamp, and `__msf` fastcall ABIs; IX is the advancing
  matrix cursor, DE is the reset-per-row vector cursor, and BC carries both
  byte induction values across calls. A four-byte stack frame holds only the
  current scalar and the authoritative outer-count checkpoint; no IY is used.
  Non-stack selected/captured metrics are 1,342/1,649 bytes and 139/149
  instructions for transposed multiply, and 1,274/1,465 bytes and 134/132
  instructions for outer product. Stack-check metrics are 1,371/1,678 bytes
  and 140/150 instructions, and 1,303/1,494 bytes and 135/133 instructions,
  respectively. `attnc11` passes full peep/nopeep. Against forcing either new
  function back while leaving the other selected, cycles remain exactly
  339,250,960 peep / 342,162,991 nopeep and peep linked size remains 23,936
  bytes; each selected function independently reduces nopeep linked size from
  25,856 to 25,728 bytes (-128). A separately named focused harness matched
  both variants and produced identical selected/forced-fallback output in
  peep and nopeep modes for ordinary operation plus output/matrix,
  output/input, right/matrix, and left/matrix alias cases. That harness caught
  and rejected an initial ordinary-stack `memset` call and an unsafe
  outer-counter iteration before the retained fastcall/register schedule.
  No app/function name, hash, performance-baseline change, or IY allocation
  participates in selection. The regression-gated stack-check census advances
  from 2109/2185 to 2111/2185 with exactly these two functions and no removal.
- The strict name-free buffered-declaration scheduler admits
  `forint.parse_decls`. It validates the complete 72-instruction, 11-block
  graph: the signed `i < g_ns` bound, per-iteration `g_stmts` reload and
  66-byte record stride, text-field load, `strcpy` then `trim`, all three
  ordered prefix tests, their `parse_decl` calls and type arguments, every
  false edge, and the cursor PHI/increment/backedge. The emitter keeps the
  cursor in BC, saves it across the complete call sequence, retains the
  original 162-byte IX frame, and caches the stable buffer address in the
  promoted cursor's otherwise dead frame slot. It reloads both globals at
  their source evaluation points and uses no IY. Non-stack selected output is
  1,290 text bytes / 124 instructions versus 1,452 / 138 captured;
  stack-check output is 1,319 / 125 versus 1,481 / 139. Against forced
  fallback, `forint` improves from 658,293,675 to 658,293,229 peep cycles
  (-446) and from 698,119,833 to 698,118,064 nopeep cycles (-1,769), with
  linked sizes unchanged at 33,152 / 36,608 bytes. A separately renamed
  `scan_declaration_buffer` clone selects with identical stack-check metrics.
  No app/function name, hash, performance-baseline change, or IY allocation
  participates in selection. The regression-gated stack-check census is
  2109/2185 with exactly this one new function and no removal.
- The strict name-free action-dispatch scheduler admits
  `forint.decode_action`. The two requested 11-block graphs do not support one
  safe shared emitter family: `decode_action` is a local-free two-parameter
  branch dispatcher, while `parse_decls` is a bounded global-table loop with a
  162-byte local buffer. The higher-value old gap was therefore selected
  (`decode_action` +936 bytes versus `parse_decls` +688 under stack check).
  The matcher validates the complete 80-instruction graph, both pointer
  parameters, three short-circuited prefix calls, the initial/default, GOTO,
  RETURN, and target-label stores, the label parser call, the separator search,
  the three-argument assignment decoder call, and all four source return
  paths. The emitter reloads parameters from a stable IX frame around every
  call, performs the default action write before classification, retains the
  GOTO action write before parsing its target, and uses no IY. Non-stack
  selected output is 1,135 text bytes / 108 instructions versus 1,307 / 123
  captured; stack-check output is 1,164 / 109 versus 1,336 / 124. Against
  forced fallback, `forint` improves from 658,293,779 to 658,293,675 peep
  cycles (-104) and from 698,125,957 to 698,119,833 nopeep cycles (-6,124);
  peep linked size is unchanged at 33,152 bytes and nopeep falls from 36,736
  to 36,608 bytes (-128 / -0.35%). A separately renamed `action_dispatch`
  clone selects with identical stack-check metrics. No app/function name,
  hash, baseline exception, or IY allocation participates in selection. The
  fresh stack-check census is 2108/2185 with exactly this one new function and
  no regression.
- The strict name-free whitespace-scan scheduler admits `cint.skip_ws`. It
  matches the complete 60-instruction, eight-block MIR graph, proves the
  signed 32-bit source-cursor bound, preserves the unsigned-byte helper call
  and short-circuit edges, reloads the source pointer and cursor after that
  call before testing newline, and retains the 16-bit line update plus
  full-width cursor increment in source evaluation order. The emitter holds
  only the global state address in IX, reloads all mutable fields around the
  helper call, and uses no IY. Non-stack selected output is 661 text bytes /
  57 instructions versus 1,423 / 139 captured; stack-check output is 690 /
  58 versus 1,452 / 140. Against forced fallback, `cint` improves from
  299,327,627 to 299,201,573 peep cycles (-126,054 / -0.0421%) and from
  305,443,007 to 305,244,693 nopeep cycles (-198,314 / -0.0649%); peep
  linked size is unchanged at 31,360 bytes and nopeep falls from 36,224 to
  36,096 bytes (-128 / -0.35%). A separately named fixture with a
  side-effecting helper selects the same structural schedule and produces
  identical peep, nopeep, and forced-fallback cursor/line/call-count output
  for mutation-after-call, empty-bound, and multiline whitespace cases. No
  app/function name, hash, baseline exception, or IY allocation participates
  in selection. The fresh stack-check census is 2107/2185 with exactly this
  one new function and no regression.
- The strict name-free symbol-table scheduler admits `bint.sym_find`. It
  matches the complete 87-instruction, seven-block MIR graph, proves the
  signed `i < nsym` bound and both `nsym`/`mtop` capacity checks, preserves the
  two-argument string-comparison call, `strncpy`, both error calls, both return
  cases, and every observable `sym`, `nsym`, and `mtop` access. The frameless
  emitter keeps the index in BC, record cursor in HL, and loop bound in DE,
  saving and restoring all three across comparison calls; the input name is
  retained on the machine stack and neither IX nor IY is used. Non-stack
  selected output is 1,533 text bytes / 151 instructions versus 2,063 / 196
  captured; stack-check output is 1,562 / 152 versus 2,092 / 197. Against
  forced fallback, `bint` improves from 334,564,928 to 334,558,534 peep cycles
  (-6,394 / -0.0019%) and from 336,986,804 to 336,973,716 nopeep cycles
  (-13,088 / -0.0039%); peep linked size is unchanged at 22,144 bytes and
  nopeep falls from 24,448 to 24,320 bytes (-128 / -0.52%). A separately
  named `lookup_symbol` clone selects with identical stack-check metrics. No
  app/function name, hash, baseline exception, IX frame, or IY allocation
  participates in selection. The fresh stack-check census is 2106/2185 with
  exactly this one new function and no regression.
- The strict name-free comment-scan scheduler admits `fint.skip_comment`. It
  matches the complete 60-instruction, seven-block MIR graph and validates
  the signed 32-bit cursor bound, old-cursor byte load, full-width cursor
  increment, newline line-number update, closing-delimiter exit, Ctrl-Z
  cursor-to-end assignment, and loop/exit edges structurally. The emitter
  retains the state pointer in IX, the low cursor word in BC, the source
  pointer in DE, and the scanned byte in A; the high cursor word and 32-bit
  end remain authoritative in memory, and IY is not used. Non-stack selected
  output is 691 text bytes / 61 instructions versus 1,651 / 162 captured;
  stack-check output is 720 / 62 versus 1,680 / 163. The ordinary `fint`
  full run and forced fallback have identical peep/nopeep cycles at
  378,912,094 / 382,764,623; peep linked size is unchanged at 32,128 bytes,
  while nopeep falls from 35,072 to 34,944 bytes (-128 / -0.36%). A focused
  multiline-comment fixture improves from 674,391 to 654,615 peep cycles
  (-2.93%) and from 739,128 to 715,939 nopeep cycles (-3.14%). Selected and
  forced-fallback outputs are byte-identical for closing-delimiter,
  multiline line-number, embedded Ctrl-Z, and end-boundary cases. A separately
  named `scan_comment_body` clone selects with the same 720-byte /
  62-instruction stack-check metrics. No app/function name, hash, baseline
  exception, or IY allocation participates in selection. The fresh
  stack-check census is 2105/2185 with exactly this one new function and no
  regression.
- The strict name-free context-operation scheduler admits `tctxops.main`. It
  matches the complete 433-instruction, seven-block MIR graph, retains the
  eight-iteration long-array initialization loop and both global float stores,
  and preserves all 33 helper, 33 checker, and two `printf` calls in their
  original side-effect order. Each helper prototype, constant argument,
  result conversion, checker type, expected value, string, repeated-callee
  relationship, and final success/failure branch is validated structurally;
  no app/function-name, hash, or baseline exception participates in selection.
  The emitter is frameless, uses neither IX nor IY, and keeps the
  initialization and final report branches executable. Non-stack selected
  output is 8,286 text bytes / 886 instructions versus 9,047 / 970 captured;
  stack-check output is 8,315 /
  887 versus 9,076 / 971. Against forced fallback, `tctxops` improves from
  122,667 to 105,614 peep cycles (-13.90%) and from 124,726 to 107,409
  nopeep cycles (-13.88%), with linked sizes non-regressing at 10,752 and
  11,008 bytes respectively. The fresh stack-check census is 2104/2185 with
  exactly this one new function and no regression. A separately named
  `context_driver` clone selected through the same matcher (8,315 / 887
  versus 9,067 / 970 captured) and produced byte-identical output in peep,
  nopeep, and forced-fallback runs.
- The strict name-free ctype/reallocation scheduler admits `tctype.main`. It
  matches the complete five-block graph, preserves all 14 ctype, 17 checker,
  five `printf`, and six allocation/string calls in their MIR side-effect
  order, and retains each null-return branch plus the final global-failure
  report. The emitter keeps the pointer in one persistent stack word, has no
  IX frame and uses no IY. Zero-result ctype checks use a direct HL truth test
  so the shipping peep path remains profitable. Non-stack selected output is
  3,885 text bytes / 381 instructions versus 4,423 / 430 captured;
  stack-check output is 3,914 / 382 versus 4,452 / 431. Against forced
  fallback, `tctype` improves from 23,887 to 23,800 peep cycles (-0.36%) and
  from 24,372 to 23,766 nopeep cycles (-2.49%). Peep linked size remains
  7,424 bytes; nopeep falls from 7,680 to 7,424 bytes (-256 / -3.33%). The
  fresh stack-check census is 2103/2185 with exactly this one new function
  and no regression. A separately named scratch clone added `EOF`, 128, and
  255 inputs to `isalpha`/`toupper`/`tolower`; the same matcher selected its
  4,536-byte / 444-instruction stack-check graph versus 5,189 / 502 captured,
  and peep, nopeep, and forced-fallback runs all printed
  `ctype/realloc ok`.
- The strict name-free VLA pointer-element switch scheduler admits
  `tvla.vla_ptr2d_deref_chain_switch`. It matches the complete 51-instruction,
  five-block MIR graph, proves the two word parameters at their ABI offsets,
  requires the pointer-to-array runtime-stride marker, validates all three
  explicit `0*6 + 1*2` dereference address chains, and preserves the case and
  default word stores plus the final nonvolatile reload. The frameless emitter
  keeps the switch branches and stack-check call, uses no IX or IY, and does
  not fold away the observable store/reload. Non-stack selected output is
  290 text bytes / 29 instructions versus 507 / 47 captured; stack-check
  output is 319 / 30 versus 536 / 48. Against forced fallback, `tvla`
  improves from 12,372,468 to 12,372,363 peep cycles (-105) and from
  14,771,615 to 14,771,454 nopeep cycles (-161), with linked sizes unchanged
  at 29,696 / 35,328 bytes. The fresh stack-check census is 2102/2185 with
  exactly this one new function and no regression. A separately named
  `pointer_switch` scratch clone selected through the same matcher and produced
  `20 20 99 99` in peep, nopeep, and forced-fallback runs, exercising both
  switch branches and both observable stores/reloads.
- The strict name-free math-verification scheduler admits `tmathf.main`. It
  structurally matches the complete two-block graph and preserves all five
  `printf`, 74 `chk`, 16 `chkx`, and 84 math-runtime calls in their original
  evaluation order, including the `frexpf`/`modff` pointer outputs and four
  int-to-float conversions. Emission reuses the ordinary symbol-call,
  reverse-argument, float-constant, and cleanup helpers; it does not evaluate
  any math result at compile time. One four-byte IX frame overlays the
  two-byte exponent output with the later four-byte float output, and no IY is
  used. Non-stack selected output is 19,750 text bytes / 2,042 instructions
  versus 20,184 / 2,090 captured; stack-check output is 19,779 / 2,043 versus
  20,213 / 2,091. `tmathf` improves from 2,993,444 to 2,978,018 peep cycles
  (-0.52%) and from 3,004,974 to 2,984,180 nopeep cycles (-0.69%); linked size
  falls 256 bytes in both modes. The stack-check census is 2101/2185 with
  exactly this one new function and no regression.
- The strict name-free compound-check scheduler admits `tcaslv.main`. A
  sequential MIR proof validates all 116 local/pointer/array/member stores,
  folds only proven integer values, and preserves all 71 `chk` calls, the
  zero-argument compound-assignment helper call, the final failure load and
  the success print in their original order. Emission uses a 23-byte IX frame
  and no IY. Non-stack selected output is 10,462 text bytes / 1,044
  instructions versus 17,650 / 1,728 captured; stack-check output is 10,491 /
  1,045 versus 17,679 / 1,729. `tcaslv` improves from 2,222,225 to 2,210,323
  peep cycles (-0.54%) and from 2,229,962 to 2,217,366 nopeep cycles (-0.56%);
  linked size falls 1,280 / 1,152 bytes. The fresh non-stack census is
  2011/2101 and the stack-check census is 2100/2185, each with exactly this
  one new function and no regression.
- The strict name-free final-call scheduler admits `tstdlib.main`. It matches
  the exact two-block call graph structurally, preserves all 77 calls
  (including four `abs`, four `labs`, ten `atoi`, fifteen `atol`, ten
  direct div/ldiv wrappers among 43 checker calls, and the success print), and
  emits every outer argument in reverse ABI order. The function is frameless
  and uses neither IX nor IY. Non-stack selected output falls from 7,427 to 7,363
  text bytes and from 779 to 768 instructions; stack-check output falls from
  7,456 to 7,392 bytes and from 780 to 769 instructions. Against forced
  fallback, `tstdlib` changes from 125,360 to 125,358 peep cycles (-2) and
  from 127,063 to 126,939 nopeep cycles (-124), with linked sizes unchanged
  at 9,472 bytes. The fresh non-stack census is 2010/2101 and the stack-check
  census is 2099/2185, each with exactly this one new function and no
  regression.
- The name-free pointer-alias mix scheduler admits
  `tptrlhs.touch_alias_mix`. It structurally validates all 22 local pointer
  initializations, retains each of the six runtime global pointer-member
  loads, and preserves all 24 observable stores and 24 checker calls in
  source order. The emitted function is frameless and uses no IY. In the
  stack-check census, selected output falls from 15,723 to 5,526 text bytes
  and from 1,537 to 533 instructions; the rejected spilled candidate was
  20,343 bytes / 1,867 instructions. `tptrlhs` improves from 974,367 to
  925,005 peep cycles (-5.07%) and from 1,021,278 to 967,079 nopeep cycles
  (-5.31%); linked size falls 1,152/1,664 bytes. The fresh non-stack census
  is 2009/2101 and the stack-check census is 2098/2185, each with exactly
  this one new function and no regression.
- The name-free bitfield report scheduler admits `tbitfld.main`. It reuses one
  four-byte IX aggregate slot, uses no IY, preserves all 12 `printf`, eight
  aggregate-sum, and two hidden-buffer aggregate-return calls, and emits direct
  packed constants for structurally proven assignments and RMW results. In the
  stack-check census, selected output falls from 21,489 to 4,616 text bytes and
  from 2,485 to 480 instructions. `tbitfld` improves from 361,103 to 348,102
  peep cycles (-3.60%) and from 364,093 to 350,003 nopeep cycles (-3.87%);
  linked size falls 2,432/2,688 bytes. The fresh non-stack census is
  2008/2101 and the stack-check census is 2097/2185, each with exactly this one
  new function and no regression.
- The name-free local-array/struct check scheduler admits
  `tpostptr.test_arrays_and_structs`. It packs the arrays and struct into one
  70-byte IX frame without overlapping potentially escaped call arguments,
  uses no IY, and preserves all 12 mutation-helper plus 24 checker calls.
  In the stack-check census, selected output falls from 10,418 to 6,604 text
  bytes and from 1,036 to 680 instructions. `tpostptr` improves from 99,558
  to 95,743 peep cycles (-3.83%) and from 104,611 to 101,323 nopeep cycles
  (-3.14%); linked size falls 640/512 bytes. The fresh non-stack census is
  2007/2101 and the stack-check census is 2096/2185, each with exactly this
  one new function and no regression.
- The scheduled wide div-result checker preserves the eight-byte hidden
  `ldiv_t` return buffer and reverse call ABI, compares quotient/remainder
  directly in DE:HL, and validates `quot*denom+rem` with one `__lmul`. This
  admits `tstdlib.check_ldiv`; `tstdlib` improves from 126,755 to 125,360
  peep cycles (-1.10%) and 129,028 to 127,063 nopeep cycles (-1.52%), while
  linked size falls by 128 bytes peep and 256 bytes nopeep.
- `a1` is **23/23 MIR**. Relative to main it is **11.12% faster peep** and
  **12.98% faster nopeep**, with no checked size regression.
- The release gate is clean: 314 runnable apps, diagnostics, 22 dccpeep
  fixtures, and the extended suite pass in both peep/nopeep modes.
- Large-CFG MIR now uses depth-three LIFO stack handoffs, typed compact byte
  slots, call-bounded store-address forwarding, single-use unary forwarding,
  and direct `+1/+2` increments. Tagged byte-slot cleanup and final liveness
  narrowing in dccpeep preserve larger canonical passes.
- The scheduled byte-array reduction keeps the pointer in BC, the accumulator
  in DE, and the endpoint in callee-saved IY. `treg.sumarray` is newly MIR and
  improves **7.33% peep / 8.65% nopeep**.
- The fixed-three-column word reduction flattens `tvla.vla_sum2d` to one
  endpoint loop. It is newly MIR and improves both modes while reducing linked
  size by 256/384 bytes.
- The structurally profiled VLA wide-truncation loop admits
  `tvla.vla_long_rhs_store` after forced dual-mode A/B proved it faster and
  smaller; the predicate is terminal, hashless, and matches one candidate.
- The structurally profiled variadic macro-validation loop admits
  `tvariad.check_macro_values`; forced and production full-mode runs improve
  about 5% in both modes and reduce linked size.
- The scheduled fixed-wide zero scan admits hot `catalan.is_zero`, improving
  both modes and shrinking 128 bytes. The profiled call-check runner predicate
  admits both `tstretst.run_direct` and `run_helper`; together they improve
  0.66% peep / 4.87% nopeep.
- The constant byte-fill scheduler admits `tecreg.fill_bytes`, using HL/A/B
  instead of a frame induction slot. It improves 5.74% peep / 28.07% nopeep.
- The local fill+sum+print scheduler admits `tecreg.main`, completing that app's
  MIR coverage and improving it 43.37% peep / 59.46% nopeep.
- The affine byte-fill scheduler keeps the pointer in HL and fill byte in A,
  deriving each stored byte from B+C without frame traffic. Its companion
  local reduction scheduler admits `tctrreg.stamp` and `tctrreg.main`,
  completing that app's MIR coverage and improving it 24.68% peep / 40.49%
  nopeep.
- The terminal constant-switch scheduler uses frameless SP-relative parameter
  access and word result tables. A bounded constant-flow evaluator folds pure
  local fallthrough updates while rejecting parameter-dependent tail control.
  It admits `tc89swjt.swdn`, `tc89swjt.swft`, and `tdead.ds_sw`;
  `tc89swjt` improves 7.87% peep / 9.42% nopeep.
- The wide left-shift counter keeps the unsigned long in DE:HL and the loop
  count in BC. It admits `tcrcfix.crc_t_bits_probe`, improving that app 7.53%
  peep / 6.70% nopeep and shrinking both linked modes.
- The palindrome scheduler scans through HL, then keeps the converging left
  and right pointers in BC and DE. It admits `tforfrm.palindrome`, beating the
  10% stretch goal at 12.35% peep / 18.80% nopeep.
- The dynamic-row scheduler keeps the evolving row in DE and the byte column
  offset in BC, rematerializing the table base only after the old row dies.
  It admits `trowptr.memory_target`, improving 4.88% peep / 5.14% nopeep.
- The bounded constant-loop check proves the induction reduction and final
  predicate before preserving only the observable check call. It admits
  `treg.test_register_int`, bringing `treg` to 9.91% peep / 12.10% nopeep
  faster than main.
- The global byte countdown collapses the modulo-256 induction count and six
  stable global loads into one register expression. It admits
  `tbcgcol.global_bc_across_byte_loop`, improving both modes.
- The bounded constant-function evaluator executes side-effect-free FINAL MIR
  with PHIs under target integer semantics and emits only the proven result.
  It admits `tnarwin.sumten` plus `tregnarw.lres/lmod/lbig`; the latter app
  improves 70.01% peep / 73.32% nopeep.
- The conditional string reporter retains the name pointer in BC, selects the
  result string once, and pushes printf arguments directly. It admits
  `tstr2.report_test` and improves both modes.
- The affine byte-fill plan now supports a constant initial A and fixed byte
  step as well as a parameter base. It admits `tptrixld.fill`, improving
  21.13% peep / 25.06% nopeep.
- Frameless signed-word range and ASCII uppercase helpers admit
  `tchess.on_board` and `tchess.upiece`. The forced-accept batch tool now
  exercises the terminal cost override rather than the obsolete earlier gate.
- The fixed word-array reduction preserves adjusted pointer qualifiers:
  stable pointers stay resident in BC, while volatile pointer objects are
  reloaded once per source access. It admits `tc99apar.sum_const` and
  `sum_volatile`, improving 6.53% peep / 7.91% nopeep.
- The by-value slice reduction derives aggregate member offsets, keeps its
  cursor in BC, accumulator in DE, and endpoint in IY. It admits
  `tc89comp.slice_sum`, improving both modes.
- Constant result tables now support up to 64 entries. This admits the
  35-case `tswitch.f`, beating the stretch goal at 10.41% peep / 11.28%
  nopeep.
- The bounded constant evaluator now tracks proven nonvolatile, non-aliased
  local object state and target-width bitwise operations. It admits
  `tbug.swbr/swfc/swwc`; `tbug` improves 30.79% peep / 27.55% nopeep.
- Compact conditional pointer identity, wide constant equality, and float
  truth schedules admit `tctxflt.ad_castptr/cfk_case/truth_while`, improving
  both modes and shrinking both linked images.
- Nested conditional word selection eliminates lossless int/float/long
  round trips for `tctxflt.cond_nested` and `cond_ncast`, improving the app
  to 2.59% peep / 2.75% nopeep faster than main.
- Direct float/int truth combinators preserve short-circuit AND/OR semantics
  without runtime helpers. They admit `tctxflt.truth_and/truth_or` and further
  reduce both modes and linked sizes.
- Conditional float-to-long emission keeps the constant arm direct and invokes
  `__faf` or a validated float-returning callee only on the false arm. It
  admits `tctxflt.cond_compound/cond_callarm`.
- Conditional global-pointer, nested member, and float-comparison schedules
  complete `tctxflt` MIR coverage. The app is 3.40% peep / 3.65% nopeep
  faster than main and both linked images are smaller.
- Conditional integer selection followed by `_Bool` normalization now emits
  as a direct truth test, admitting `tbool.ternary_bool` and improving both
  modes.
- Cleared record append keeps the record pointer in callee-saved IY across
  `memset`/`strcpy`, uses frameless SP-relative parameters, and rematerializes
  the return index. It admits `tstfield.add_word` and improves both modes.
- Backward record-name search keeps the descending index in IY across
  `strcmp` and reloads the stable name parameter only at the call boundary.
  It admits `tstfield.find_word`; that app is now 1.02% peep / 2.41% nopeep
  faster than main.
- Conditional integer selection now normalizes to the declared target width,
  admitting `ts.bc`; `ts` improves 0.44% peep / 0.48% nopeep and shrinks.
- Sequential unary reports evaluate helper calls in ABI argument order and
  push each result immediately, eliminating eight spills in `ts.shbool`.
  `ts` improves 0.50% peep / 0.59% nopeep.
- Nibble append keeps the destination in HL and classifies the value in A,
  admitting `tarray.aHexNibble`; `tarray` improves 3.05% peep / 5.04% nopeep.
- Constant IEEE float checks now prove an observable failure block unreachable,
  admitting `tc89c2.test_huge_val`; `tc89c2` improves 4.55% peep / 5.33%
  nopeep and shrinks further.
- Volatile local fill plus constant wide-shift proof preserves all 160 required
  stores while eliminating dead wide frame traffic. It admits
  `tcrcfix.non_ix_shift_store_probe`; `tcrcfix` improves 36.49% peep / 38.00%
  nopeep.
- Signed div/mod check wrappers now emit only the result that reaches `ck`,
  eliminating each dead companion operation. This admits
  `tdmfuse.sdm_pair/sdm_pair_r`, improving 4.29% peep / 4.76% nopeep.
- Escaped local identity arrays preserve the published stack address but fold
  the known returned element, admitting `tnarrow.narwesc`; `tnarrow` improves
  2.11% peep / 2.45% nopeep.
- Wraparound boolean-neighbor loops now keep the current and next pointers,
  index, and wide live count in IY, DE, BC, and shadow BC. Replacing two signed
  modulo helpers per iteration admits `tptrarr.step` and improves the app
  83.76% peep / 85.30% nopeep (83.72% / 85.29% faster than main).
- Reduced sine/cosine polynomial kernels now preserve the established FMA
  chains while using one compact x2 slot; cosine tracks quadrant sign in one
  byte and applies it without a final float multiply. This admits
  `ttrig.sinf/cosf` with a small 0.05% dual-mode app gain; float runtime
  helpers remain the dominant stretch ceiling.
- Tangent rational kernels now retain their reduced argument and x2 in one
  compact frame, keep the numerator on the evaluation stack, directly test
  IEEE zero, and materialize a reciprocal only for inverted quadrants. This
  admits `ttrig.tanf`; the combined `ttrig` gain is 0.08% in both modes.
- Compact scalar schedules now cover word-width ASCII case mapping and
  short-circuit logical OR parameters, admitting `tchess.xtolower` and
  `tinline.edge_or`. A registerized fixed-count byte mismatch scan keeps the
  pointer, expected byte, endpoint, and index derivation in registers,
  admitting `tctresc.find_mismatch` and improving that app 1.61% peep /
  14.01% nopeep.
- Float-tolerance failure checks now keep the subtraction result in DE:HL,
  normalize its sign without a frame spill, and branch directly to the
  string-only failure report. This admits `tclit.check_float`, improving
  `tclit` 2.87% peep / 2.89% nopeep and moving it ahead of main.
- Global byte-check sequences now resolve direct, indexed, and member byte
  loads to exact symbols/offsets and push check arguments without virtual
  homes. This admits `tbool.check_globals`, improving `tbool` 0.64% peep /
  0.75% nopeep and removing the final homed-backend fallback.
- Variable-step byte reductions now hold the narrowed induction value in B,
  its step in C, and the word accumulator in DE. The alias-aware form proves
  the local pointer cannot escape and folds its conditional extra update.
  This admits `tpeepal.byte_loop_cache/byte_loop_alias`, improving the app
  1.38% peep / 1.83% nopeep.
- Recursive binary-tree sums now keep wide partial sums on the evaluation
  stack across child calls and inline carry-preserving long additions. Both
  native-wide and sign-extended word members are supported, admitting
  `tclit.sum_tree` and `too.bst_inorder_sum`; `tclit` improves 4.20%/5.24%
  and `too` 1.84%/2.11%.
- Recursive wide linear recurrences now share the product scheduler and select
  either the long multiply helper or an inline carry-preserving addition.
  This admits `triangle.triangle`, improving 23.56% peep / 24.54% nopeep.
- Fixed attention sample kernels now reverse-copy word arrays with IY and fill
  a word array from a no-argument producer while retaining the destination
  pointer across calls. This admits `attnc11.make_targets/generate_sample`
  and reduces the linked nopeep image by 128 bytes.

  direct byte/word stores. This admits `tchess.init_board`, replacing its
  loop and frame traffic with 13 machine instructions.

  each pointer argument directly from its global base and byte stride. This
  admits `attnc11.project_logits` with a dual-mode cycle reduction.
- Compact call-sum reports now preserve intermediate results on the evaluation
  stack across one- and zero-argument calls, then pass the final sum directly
  to the report call. This admits `tasmcoll.main` with a dual-mode gain.
- Dynamic global-array FMA updates now keep the selected element address in IY,
  feed the three float operands directly to `__fmaf`, store the result once,
  and return it without a reload. This admits `tfmadd.array_case`.
- Wide union-bitcast call wrappers now pass float payloads directly through
  the long call ABI and return the resulting bits without local aggregates.
  This admits `tfdf.fdf`, improving 10.37% peep / 10.52% nopeep.
- Wide shift comparisons now add a sign-extended word to a long on the
  evaluation stack, perform constant arithmetic shifts in registers, and use
  a biased inline signed threshold comparison. This admits `tctxops.sh_cmp`.
- Conditional wide additions now choose the wide parameter before evaluation,
  sign-extend the shared word operand, and perform the long addition directly
  on the evaluation stack. This admits `tctxops.ca_tern`.
- Terminal two-case wide switches now evaluate the shared word-plus-long
  expression once and compare DE:HL bytewise without spills. This admits
  `tctxops.ca_switch`.
- Bounded pointer-member appends now keep the aggregate base in IY, update the
  count in BC, and address the pointer array directly. This admits
  `too.world_add`.
- Fixed prediction-count loops now keep the row index in IY, reuse one IX
  result slot across helper calls, and update the global hit/total counters
  directly. This admits `attnc11.count_predictions`.
- The fixed prediction loop now also supports a prefix call and persistent
  boolean result byte, admitting `attnc11.check_sequence`.
- Random wide fills now retain the destination pointer in IY, derive one
  endpoint, and construct each signed Q16 result directly from the producer's
  low byte. This admits `attnc11.initialize_weight_group`.
- Fixed byte-board setup now clears the global board through a register
  endpoint loop, stores the selected byte directly, and emits the ordinary
  four-word call ABI without a frame. This admits `ttt.FindSolution`.
  dccpeep recognizes that MIR call shape and coordinates it with its existing
  whole-file MinMax packed-byte ABI rewrite; `ttt` improves slightly in both
  peep and nopeep modes rather than losing the packed-call optimization.
- Recursive fixed-frame word fills now preserve the source array as a compact
  16-byte IX frame while keeping its pointer in HL, fill value in DE, and
  count in B. Indexed publication and the recursive recurrence are emitted
  directly. This admits `tstackov.descend` and
  `tpragstk.guarded_descend`, improving them 52.03%/57.36% and
  49.11%/54.43% in peep/nopeep modes respectively while preserving the stack
  guard's observable overflow.
- Two-element pointer-member membership checks now keep the searched word in
  BC, load each aggregate pointer directly from its frameless parameter, and
  compare the two adjacent word members without PHI materialization. This
  admits `wumpus.hpit` and `wumpus.hbat` with no app-level regression.
- Wide bitcast call scheduling now handles three float parameters as well as
  two: it pushes their raw bits directly in reverse ABI order and returns the
  wide result without materializing four local unions. This admits
  `tfmaddr.fmaddr` plus `tfmaf.fmadd_/fmaf_`; both apps beat the stretch goal
  at 10.62%/10.73% and 13.17%/13.29% faster in peep/nopeep modes.
- Inline float-tolerance reports now keep the subtraction in DE:HL, normalize
  its magnitude without a local float slot, compare the fixed epsilon
  directly, and push the original values only on failure. This admits
  `tpromo.ck_f` and `tctxops.chkf`, improving those apps 3.01%/3.09% and
  3.55%/3.75% in peep/nopeep modes.
- Global record-pop loops now reload the cheap global state root at each
  boundary, keep the decremented index in BC, form the six-byte record address
  directly, and return immediately on the selected kind. Avoiding IY prevents
  file-wide allocator interference. This admits
  `tstretst.direct_return_to_call/helper_return_to_call`; `tstretst` improves
  8.64% peep / 14.67% nopeep.
- The structural call-check runner policy now allows the measured 135-byte
  textual delta caused by prelegacy callee scheduling (formerly 130);
  forced dual-mode A/B proved the same 117-instruction caller remains faster,
  preserving `tstretst.run_direct` and forward-only coverage.
- Local byte fill-and-report mains now retain only the observable byte array
  in an eight-byte IX frame, fill it with an A/HL/B loop, apply an optional
  constant patch directly, and pass its address to one or two helper/report
  pairs without induction spills. This admits `tbcreg.main` and
  `tbcregno.main`, improving them 6.54%/8.28% and 3.80%/5.25% in
  peep/nopeep modes.
- Fixed global row searches now derive one row pointer from the object member,
  keep the target word in BC, unroll the three adjacent word comparisons, and
  publish the matching value directly. This admits `wumpus.fwum`, improving
  that app 0.33% peep / 0.36% nopeep.
- Random unique-array initialization now uses a two-byte IX induction slot,
  preserves each destination address on the evaluation stack across the
  producer call, retries the fixed array until the duplicate check clears,
  then calls the validated copy helper and stores the final scalar member.
  This admits `wumpus.ginit`; together with `fwum`, `wumpus` improves
  0.45% peep / 0.49% nopeep.
- Scheduled templates must allocate fresh machine labels with `new_label()`.
  MIR CFG label IDs are function-local and can collide in the assembly file;
  the fixed-row, local-fill/report, global-record-pop, and random-init
  schedules now all use fresh labels. The full forward-only census remains
  clean after the correction.
- IEEE NaN-bit predicates now test the exponent and mantissa directly from the
  four-byte frameless parameter, avoiding a wide alias local plus shift/mask
  helpers. This admits `tfmaf.is_nan_bits`; combined with the bitcast-call
  schedules, `tfmaf` improves 13.81% peep / 14.03% nopeep and shrinks both
  linked modes by more than 6%.
- Multi-call scalar reports now evaluate one-argument callees in the
  established reverse argument order, push each result directly, then call
  the variadic reporter without virtual result slots. The profitability shape
  requires at least two calls; the one-call `tbcint` case measured slower and
  remains on its faster homed selector. This admits `tdead.main` and also
  improves the already-MIR `tmircfg.main`; both modes are no worse.
- Null-safe string assertions now increment the check counter directly, test
  the nullable string before a frameless `strcmp`, and update/report failures
  only on the cold path. This admits `tstrconv.oks`, improving both modes and
  shrinking the nopeep image by 128 bytes.
- No-argument test runners now call each validated test directly, report
  check/failure globals without slots, select the PASS/FAIL string in
  registers, and normalize the failure count for the return. This admits
  `tdmfuse.main`, improving the app slightly beyond its existing 4.3%/4.8%
  peep/nopeep gains and shrinking the nopeep image by 128 bytes.
- Float modulo normalization now calls the validated two-wide-argument helper
  directly, keeps its result on the evaluation stack across an exact float
  comparison with zero, and invokes `__faf` only for a negative result. This
  preserves NaN and negative-zero semantics while admitting `pihex.fpart`;
  both modes improve and both linked images shrink by 128 bytes.
- Fixed allocation runners now issue two validated `calloc` calls, publish the
  global state/member pointers explicitly, retain a canonical one-byte IX
  loop counter across two no-argument tests, and report success directly.
  Avoiding IY preserves file-wide dccpeep opportunities. This admits
  `tstretst.main`, completing that app's MIR coverage and improving it
  8.68% peep / 14.70% nopeep while shrinking nopeep by 256 bytes.
- String/putchar loops now preserve the original signed preliminary subscript
  check, keep a two-byte cursor in a compact IX frame across calls, and pass

  `tgnarly` 0.42% peep / 0.58% nopeep.
- Fixed call reductions now hold the word sum in callee-saved IY across 35
  helper calls, keep the byte induction value in one IX slot, and evaluate
  final report calls in established reverse argument order. This admits
  `tswitch.main`, completing that app's MIR coverage and beating the stretch
  goal at 15.42% peep / 17.08% nopeep.
- Aggregate byte-fill returns now write directly into the ABI hidden result
  destination, using HL/A/B for the 40-byte sequence and appending the word
  tag in place instead of constructing and copying a 42-byte local. This
  admits `tstructv.proto_make_big`, completing that app's MIR coverage and
  improving it 3.85% peep / 6.07% nopeep.
- Last-record kind predicates now reject nonpositive counts, preserve the
  decremented index across large member-offset materialization, form the
  fixed-stride record address directly, and compare its word kind without a
  pointer local. This admits hot `fint.last_is_lit`, improving both modes and
  shrinking both linked images by 128 bytes.
- Local byte-fill validator calls now allocate only the observable byte array,
  fill it through HL/A/B, apply a direct constant corruption patch, and pass
  the frame address to the unchanged three-argument checker. This admits
  `tcpirlp.main`, improving 1.47% peep / 7.36% nopeep.
- Fixed member initialization now stores the constant name/count directly,
  unrolls three aggregate-element helper calls with frameless parameter
  reloads, and preserves each element index and pointer ABI. This admits
  `too.gallery_init`; `too` improves 1.86% peep / 2.18% nopeep.
- Volatile member sums now perform exactly one volatile pointer load per
  iteration, keep the total in BC with explicit saves across the mutating
  call, and use only one IX byte for the index. This admits
  `tvolopt.volatile_member_reload`, improving 0.55% peep / 0.67% nopeep.
- Mixed scalar reports now run setup once, evaluate eleven validated direct or
  indirect producers in established reverse argument order, and push results
  directly to the variadic report. This admits `tvolopt.main`; the app now
  improves 0.62% peep / 0.81% nopeep while retaining all volatile helpers.
- Volatile local-width kernels now perform every required volatile word
  store/load in an eight-byte IX frame, retain only the nonvolatile sum in BC,
  and execute the volatile counter's separate test and increment reads. This
  admits `tvolopt.volatile_local_widths`, completes that app's MIR coverage,
  and improves it 0.76% peep / 1.42% nopeep.
- File line loops now allocate the fixed line buffer and file slot directly,
  preserve fopen/perror/fgets/fputs/fclose argument order, and recompute the
  buffer address only at call boundaries. This admits `texfile.main`,
  completing that app's MIR coverage and reducing nopeep size by 128 bytes.
- The structurally smaller `pint.alloc_temp` schedule remains experimental
  behind `DCC_MIR_EXPERIMENTAL_SCOPED_TEMP`: the authoritative full-mode
  configuration regressed 0.26% peep / 0.16% nopeep, so production correctly
  retains the established backend.
- Wide hash-33 loops now keep the accumulator in DE:HL, preserve the original
  value on the evaluation stack across five inline shifts, retain the input
  byte in A, and track the pointer in one IX word. This admits
  `tlngfptr.hash33`, completes that app's MIR coverage, and improves it
  4.58% peep / 5.13% nopeep while shrinking both modes by 256 bytes.
- Scaled global loads now compute `base + index*scale` once through `__mulu`,
  then select a byte or little-endian word load from the shared address
  without spill slots. This admits `tinline.mem_get` with no app-level
  regression.
- Scaled global stores now reuse the same one-time address computation, keep
  the value in DE while the address sits on the evaluation stack, and store
  either one byte or a little-endian word based on the original scale. This
  admits `tinline.mem_set` with no app-level regression.
- Fixed global string copies now fold each post-incremented row address as
  `old_index*16`, call the existing `__scf` fastcall directly, and push the
  three final row pointers without spills. This admits `tfcarg2d.main`,
  improving both modes and shrinking nopeep by 128 bytes.
- Signed multiply/clamp helpers now evaluate the product once, retain it in
  BC, saturate outside ±100, and return the absolute in-range value without
  an inline temporary or PHI materialization. This admits
  `tinline.nest_scale_and_clamp` with no app-level regression.
- The bounded constant evaluator now accepts static/deferred zero-argument
  functions and tracks local address identities through direct/indirect
  stores. Existing MIR functions in `tc89size`, `tc99scpe`, `tgoto`, and
  `tgotocap` move to smaller scheduled constants with large dual-mode gains.
- A strict local-dereference induction proof handles address-taken scalar
  loops whose named locals do not yet receive MIR object IDs. This admits
  `tforinc.deref_compound_init`, improving that app 3.01% peep / 4.58%
  nopeep and shrinking both images.
- The companion fixed-index local-array proof tracks one nonescaping element
  through compound initialization, loop accumulation, and increment. This
  admits `tforinc.index_compound_init`; the combined app gain reaches
  6.39% peep / 9.29% nopeep with both images smaller.
- Compact record appends now bounds-check the global cursor, form
  `records + cursor*5` once, store byte/word/word fields directly from
  parameters, and post-increment while returning the old index. This admits
  hot `bint.emit`, improving both modes.
- Byte mismatch reporters now emit the corrected CPI loop directly: NZ exits
  immediately on mismatch, PE alone controls continuation, and HL is backed
  up before the cold offset/byte report. This admits `tcpirlp.chk`, completes
  that app's MIR coverage, and improves 2.24% peep / 13.56% nopeep.
- The existing byte arithmetic report scheduler now admits its already-coded
  unsigned path, selecting `__mulu/__modu/__divu` and zero-extending each
  byte result/argument. This admits `tmuldiv.ui8_test`, completes that app's
  MIR coverage, and improves both modes.
- Affine local fill/report schedules now support a non-one initial byte,
  a checker argument distinct from the fill count, and a patch inserted between
  reports. This admits `tctresc.main`, completes that app's MIR coverage, and
  improves 4.46% peep / 28.49% nopeep.
- Pointer word sums now keep the cursor in HL, count in B, and accumulator in
  DE, stop immediately on a zero word, and materialize the stable global
  contribution only at entry/normal exit. This admits
  `tbcgcol.global_bc_across_pointer_loop`, completes that app's MIR coverage,
  and improves 3.84% peep / 5.91% nopeep.
- Fixed static byte scans now resolve function-local static link names from
  MIR declaration metadata, preserve all six byte stores, prove the first-zero
  scan result/pointer invariants, and emit the three successful check calls
  directly. This admits `treg.test_scan`; `treg` now beats the stretch goal at
  11.48% peep / 13.81% nopeep with both images smaller.

  directly after structurally validating the if/negation/one-iteration while
  graph. This admits `tbool.check_conditions`, improving the app 1.77% peep /
  2.00% nopeep with smaller images.
- Fixed-count variadic join orchestration now keeps the destination scan and
  comma count in registers around the exact seven-argument call and final
  report. This admits `tvapinit.main`, improving the app 7.75% peep / 14.01%
  nopeep while shrinking both linked images.

  nopeep and shrinking both linked images by about 7%.

  5.11% peep / 5.54% nopeep.
- Fixed call/spill runners now keep the call-crossing pointer in callee-saved
  IY, use one frame word for the accumulator, unroll the five calls and check

  peep / 0.48% nopeep while shrinking both linked images by about 3.7%.

  runtime byte data: word pairs are proven directly, while byte pairs update
  fixed IX-relative slots after the required string copy. This admits
  `tpostinc.test_int_ptr_math` and `test_char_ptr_math`; cumulative app gains
  reach 1.07% peep / 1.36% nopeep with 7.55% / 9.09% smaller images.
- Unescaped local string-pair records now collapse to their two observable
  reports, preserving the original four string values without allocating or

  app 1.05% peep / 1.12% nopeep with 2.04% smaller images.
- Aggregate sign normalizers now write the by-value parameter directly to the
  hidden return buffer, using one eight-byte copy on the nonnegative path and
  registerized 32-bit negation on the negative path. This admits
  `tsretret.normalize`; cumulative app gains reach 7.41% peep / 8.01% nopeep.
- Aggregate-return report runners now use four fixed hidden-result buffers,
  pass the nested by-value aggregate as four direct word pushes and stream six
  long report arguments to the mapped formatter. This admits `tsretret.main`,
  eliminating the app's last fallback; cumulative gains reach 7.68% peep /
  8.42% nopeep.
- CP/M file-size helpers now allocate only the FCB, issue initialize/BDOS calls
  directly, load r0/r1 into HL and shift the record count through DE:HL.
  This admits `cpmenumd.file_size`; both runtime modes remain correctness-clean
  (the app is excluded from deterministic performance comparison).
- Constant-check scheduling now supports exact local `_Bool` array/member
  proofs and name-last checker ABIs, reusing the generic direct-call emitter.
  This admits `tbool.check_locals`; cumulative app gains reach 3.89% peep /
  4.42% nopeep with 4.55% / 5.80% smaller linked images.
- Block-scope compound-literal runners now retain only the two pair objects
  needed by observable pair checks and emit seven proven scalar checks
  directly. This admits `tclit.check_block_literals`, improving the app 5.92%
  peep / 7.26% nopeep with 4.00% / 5.19% smaller linked images.

  one hidden pair result and emit constant long/float/scalar checks without
  materializing the surrounding literals. This admits
  `tclit.check_value_literals_extra`; cumulative app gains reach 8.53% peep /
  9.98% nopeep with 6.67% / 9.09% smaller images.
- Scaled vector-add loops now retain the scalar in IY, keep source/destination
  state in a seven-byte IX frame and carry wide multiply/add values through
  DE:HL helper boundaries. This admits `attnc11.vector_scaled_add`, improving
  both modes slightly and shrinking the nopeep image by 0.98%.
- Hall initializers now retain the hall index in IY, keep only the formatting
  buffer, use the `__scf` DE-destination/HL-source ABI and unroll the three
  exhibit calls. This admits `too.hall_init`; cumulative app gains reach
  2.38% peep / 2.74% nopeep.
- Local bitfield assignment/check runners now reuse the constant-check emitter
  after validating a strict one-block bitfield-only graph. This admits

  with smaller images.
- Pointer-difference orchestration now preserves both scaling helper calls and

  peep / 4.36% nopeep and shrinking both images.
- Packed mantissa/exponent/sign decoders now extract the byte directly, shift
  in HL and return a sign-extended DE:HL value without a frame. This admits
  `tpeepal.decode` and cuts the app images to 11.54% / 13.21% below baseline.
- Closed local sort/search examples now emit their proven found-value/index
  report directly. This admits `texsort.main`, improving the app 66.31% peep /
  67.54% nopeep and shrinking both images.
- Aggregate leaf constructors now write the hidden return buffer directly,
  reuse one long multiply result and fill fixed arrays with compact register
  loops. This admits `tptrlhs.make_leaf`, improving the app 4.25% peep /
  4.15% nopeep while shrinking both images.
- Fixed six-dimensional affine fills now flatten six binary induction
  variables to one byte counter and one contiguous destination cursor while
  preserving every scalar helper call and its argument order. This admits
  `tarray6.fill_c/fill_i/fill_l`, improving the app 56.95% peep / 57.05%
  nopeep and shrinking both images by more than 21%.
- Fixed embedding builders now flatten the proven 8x16 traversal, derive
  destination and position addresses from one byte counter, and retain only
  the advancing token-weight cursor while preserving every clamp call. This
  admits `attnc11.build_embeddings`, saving 129,500 peep / 171,402 nopeep
  cycles and shrinking both images.
- Fixed forward-attention orchestration now keeps the query row in IY,
  compacts score/key cursors to a five-byte frame, emits the fixed transpose

  `attnc11.forward_attention`, saving another 94,248 peep / 691,740 nopeep
  cycles beyond the embedding batch.
- Four-byte representation checkers now compare parameter or pointed storage
  directly from IX, preserve both six- and ten-argument failure reports, and
  increment the resolved global failure counter without spill slots. This
  admits `tc89fadd.chk`, `tc89fcnv.chkf`, `tc89fptr.chk`, and `tc89fs.ckbf`;
  app gains range from 5.09% to 34.47% peep and 11.16% to 40.78% nopeep.
- IEEE infinity/NaN checkers now inspect the parameter bytes directly,
  preserving checks/failures accounting and the exact name-only report. This
  admits `tatof.chk_inf/chk_nan`, saving 5,326 peep / 8,226 nopeep cycles and
  shrinking the images by 2.67% / 6.41%.
- Flagged fixed-record appenders now retain the destination record in IY,
  update the count in place, index source bytes directly and call the
  classifier only on the special-capture path. This admits hot
  `tchess.add_flag_move`, saving 1.77M peep / 2.80M nopeep cycles and shrinking
  both images.
- Fixed record wildcard predicates now compare two leading bytes through BC/DE
  cursors and accept either an equal final byte or a right-side zero without a
  frame. This admits `tchess.same_move`, saving another 47,992 peep / 71,670
  nopeep cycles and one 128-byte sector in each mode.
- Dense integer switches returning string pointers now use a bounds check and
  address table, including a null default. This admits `tchess.bk_text_at`,
  removes 35 MIR blocks and saves another nopeep image sector.
- Final MIR streams now remove adjacent `exx/exx` pairs before emission while
  preserving their pre-cleanup metrics for profitability decisions. This
  improves 38 already-active apps in both modes without widening coverage;
  `tasinfsp.main` remains correctly rejected after forced A/B showed it still
  loses 0.79% peep / 0.78% nopeep and linked size.
- Terminal final-cost candidates now receive the existing constant-prepack /
  direct-push stack-argument retry only for three measured structural strata.
  This admits `taninit.chk_str`, `tc89c2.test_strtod`, and
  `tvla.vla_ptr2d_deref_chain_contexts`; all three improve both modes and the
  latter two shrink both images.
- The broad terminal-stack probe remains opt-in. It was rejected after
  `bint`, `forint`, and `pint` introduced small cycle/sector regressions and
  after `tasinfsp`, `tctype`, `tmulpow2`, `tstdlib`, and `tarray` failed one
  or more dual-mode guardrails.
- Two profiled `all`-feature strata admit `too.test_gallery` and
  `too.test_size_inference`, improving the app 2.21% peep / 2.46% nopeep and
  shrinking both images. One profiled `phi-slot` stratum admits
  `tcrcfix.argv_probe`; cumulative app gains remain 37.10% / 38.55%.
- Broad `all` and `phi-slot` terminal probes remain opt-in. The former
  displaced three active functions and crossed 23 guardrails; the latter
  displaced three and crossed 66. `tctxops`, `too.test_aggregates`, and
  `tqsort` were individually rejected for sector or cycle losses.
- The exact local constant-byte store proof now covers one measured four-block
  aggregate-runner stratum while retaining its original three-block behavior
  byte-for-byte. This admits `too.test_aggregates`; cumulative `too` gains are
  2.13% peep / 2.35% nopeep with smaller images.
- Variadic string joins now retain an explicit argument cursor in an eight-byte
  IX frame and call the `__scf`/`__slf` fastcall ABIs directly. This admits
  `tvapinit.join`, beating the stretch goal at 11.53% peep / 18.30% nopeep
  while shrinking both images.
- Fixed five-byte record-sort tests now fill through an IY cursor, call
  `_qsort` directly and validate adjacent records through `__cmpf`. This
  admits `tqsort.t_qsort_r5`, improving both modes and shrinking each image
  by one sector.
- Local bitset runners now preserve established reverse call-argument
  evaluation, keep print results on the stack, and use canonical IX-relative
  address forms. This admits `tidxasgn.main`, matching peep cycles and
  improving nopeep by 121 cycles with no size regression.
- Deterministic postfix-decrement runners now replace three proven loops with
  their observable checker calls and retain the global failure/success path.
  This admits `tpostut.main`, beating the stretch goal at 10.28% peep /
  12.88% nopeep while shrinking both images.
- Fixed sieve builders now clear through an HL cursor and mark multiples with
  four compile-time prime-stride loops. This admits `tnestfor.build_sieve`,
  improving **20.58% peep / 23.14% nopeep** while shrinking both images.
- Fixed nested-wrapper initializers now compute the shared signed base product
  once, fill aggregate fields through register cursors, and install derived
  pointers without IY. This admits the identical `tptrcnd.init_wrapper` and
  `tptrrhs.init_wrapper` graphs, improving those apps by **87.96%/87.62%**
  and **79.31%/75.44%** respectively with no image regression.
- Static-inline proof helpers are now shared across MIR selectors. A fixed
  inline-fold runner proves its four-argument byte/word setter AST before
  replacing call-shaped MIR with direct global stores, admitting
  `tinline.inline_fold_check` and improving the app **2.18%/2.44%** while
  shrinking both images.
- Fixed K&R call-check runners now retain ordinary and wide ABI argument
  ordering, keep failure state in a six-byte IX frame, and compare DE:HL
  results directly. This admits `tkandr.main`, improving **1.29%/1.83%**
  with no image regression.
- Deterministic local-initializer checks now prove every initialized offset,
  comparison family, checker call and returned load before eliding private
  aggregate storage. This admits `tc89ini2.sum_local`, improving
  **23.07%/26.13%** and shrinking both images by more than 12%.
- The existing register-framed float polynomial family now covers atan range
  reduction and fixed Taylor sine loops. Four-deep `__fmaf` Horner chaining
  and a one-byte alternating-sign state admit `ttrig.atanf` and
  `ttrig.xsinf`, improving the app **1.19%/1.22%** and shrinking both images.
- Q16.16 multiplies now decompose into signed, unsigned, and mixed 16x16
  register products, carrying the 32-bit accumulator on the machine stack
  instead of in a 16-byte frame. This admits `tshlmac.fp_mul`, beating the
  stretch goal at **19.91%/19.95%** while shrinking both images by 6.12%.
- Fixed index-call runners now initialize int, long, and record arrays in one
  compact IX frame and compare narrow/wide call results without spill slots.
  This admits `tmulpow2.main`, improving **5.75%/7.30%** and shrinking both
  images by more than 4%.
- Task-array checks now pack fixed records into a 22-byte IX frame, preserve
  both search/count helper calls, and validate the returned record in place.
  This admits `tdecl.auto_mixed_struct_array_init`, improving **0.73%/1.50%**
  while shrinking both images.
- Literal-check runners now recursively evaluate pure MIR constant
  unary/binary DAGs and replay only their observable checker calls. This admits
  `tunaryp.main`, improving both modes and shrinking images by
  **7.94%/9.38%** without a local frame.
- The same evaluator now normalizes 8/16/32-bit target constants and supports
  start/failure reports. This admits `ts32.main`, beating the stretch goal at
  **12.34%/14.25%** while shrinking images by **17.91%/20.00%**.
- A compact register schedule for `pint.alloc_temp` was rejected despite 50
  fewer instructions and one smaller sector because program placement still
  regressed **0.26%/0.16%**; no padding or baseline movement was retained.
- A direct `too.expected_area` dispatcher was rejected after repeated-call
  tests exposed incorrect signed divmod cache/register handling; it is absent.
- A binary-search replacement for `too.isqrt_l` was rejected after focused
  boundary tests exposed incorrect small-input results; it is absent.
- A candidate `pint.add_sym` schedule was rejected after it remained 0.26%
  peep / 0.16% nopeep slower despite smaller code and fast memset; it is not
  present in production.
- Do not force statically small fallbacks. `tcrcfix.non_ix_shift_store_probe`
  is 393 text bytes and 97 instructions smaller than captured output but
  regresses 11.49% peep and 5.48% nopeep dynamically.
- The other statically smaller candidates are also false wins:
  `trowinv.main` (+7.48%/+5.14%), `tautolcs.lcs` (+29.92%/+22.09%),
  `tfreopen.main` (+4.65%/+2.73%), and `t2darr.main`
  (+28.46%/+31.34%).
- Current next priority: repeated causes in the 84 final-cost fallbacks,
  followed by calibrated replacement of `register-v69`. Maintain zero
  correctness, performance, and coverage regressions.

The sections below are the chronological history of earlier branches and
experiments. Where they conflict with this checkpoint, this checkpoint wins.

## Historical 2026-08-08 policy pivot

8 days moved ordinary coverage only 43.93% -> 45.11%. The user directed a
bold pivot: **the goal is 100% MIR coverage, reached fast; performance is
not a Phase 1 gate** (relax the historical strict zero-regression rule,
since every remaining gate had accreted an individually-proven,
zero-regression bar that does not scale to 100%). Correctness is still
completely non-negotiable at every step - only the *performance* bar is
relaxed, deliberately, and every accepted regression is tracked via
`-UpdatePerfBaseline` with full documentation, never hidden. A dedicated
Phase 2 (post-100%-coverage performance recovery via `dccprof` dynamic
profiling) follows once coverage is at/near 100%. Full plan, evidence, and
rationale: session workspace `plan.md` (not tracked in git) plus each
`## Item T43x` entry in `mir-text-size-plan.md` going forward. Large agent
fleets are out - this phase is direct, foreground, tool-driven bulk
acceptance instead of one-by-one investigation.

## Goal and current state

The goal is **100% MIR-required coverage** (not an intermediate percentage
target), then a dedicated performance-recovery phase to bring aggregate
peep-mode cycles back to at/below the pre-MIR legacy baseline. Mixed-mode
transactional fallback remains in place throughout Phase 1.

- Working branch: `copilot/regional-home-af23` (local only; do not push)
- Published baseline: `45cf3f0`
- Published ordinary coverage: **890/2026 (43.93%)**
- Published stack-check coverage: **912/2128 (42.86%)**
- Current ordinary coverage: **2067/2067 (100.00%)**
- Current stack-check coverage: **2183/2183 (100.00%)**
- T503 recovers the dense unsigned-byte switch that MIR lowering had expanded
  into 153 equality branches and admits `a1.emulate`: **+1/+1**, zero
  removals.
- Local T504 extends regional homes to mixed-width/object-backed segments and
  admits `pint.factor_call_or_var` plus `pint.scan_number`: **+2/+2**, zero
  removals.
- **T504 closes the two smaller Pint holdouts.** `scan_number` is now smaller
  than captured output; `factor_call_or_var` fits the measured stack-check
  nopeep TPA boundary by one byte under a structural 3-32-block, <=24-call,
  117%/122%, <=6000-byte true-final gate.
- **T505 completes standard-corpus MIR coverage.** `pint.run` has a 43-case
  contiguous unsigned-byte dispatch, not a regional-pressure problem. Compact
  table recovery plus direct condition, postincrement-store, store/load-chain,
  and small self-store-add forms reduce it to 21720/1933 versus 23277/2046
  captured. Both censuses are 100% with zero removals; the full extended gate
  is clean.
- **Phase 2 is now active.** T506 has recovered Pint's tracked
  +2.60% peep regression and moved it beyond both pre-T505 and older published
  baselines. T507 removes `a1.emulate`'s dead recovered-switch slot stores,
  recovering 2.50% peep / 2.23% nopeep; the remaining `a1` gap is about
  1.8% peep and 0.15% nopeep versus the immediate pre-T503 baseline. T508
  fuses two retained static-inline stack-push helper calls transactionally
  inside the spilled selector, reducing the remaining gap to 1.42% peep
  while making nopeep 0.44% faster than pre-T503. T509 permits planned stack
  handoffs across balanced scalar calls, reducing the remaining gap to 0.43%
  peep while making nopeep 0.68% faster than pre-T503. T510 makes deferred
  inline-body ownership follow the selected output and fuses the last hot byte
  push, leaving only 0.33% peep while making nopeep 0.81% faster.
  T511 attacks the whole-corpus concentration leader: byte-demand and wide
  induction identities make `tbig` 92.5% faster peep, reduce total positive
  pre-MIR peep debt by 76.9%, and materially improve 13 additional apps.
  T512-T528 recover word dispatch, narrow-origin wide arithmetic, byte
  verification, word scans, large-CFG address/induction identities, and
  interpreter inline-stack/typed-memory helpers, byte minimax, and modular
  arithmetic, chess, fixed-array, fixed-point matrix, and the remaining
  interpreter and long-tail loop kernels. Sieve and the typed condition
  families now also beat pre-MIR, aggregate peep performance is 1.378B
  cycles ahead of pre-MIR, and positive per-app peep debt is 16.3M
  (-99.9% cumulatively). Continue with systemic emitter/allocation recovery,
  then prove MIR-required mode
  over the extended corpus before removing capture/replay and legacy codegen
  in separate cleanup commits.
- **Key finding this segment: the mega-experiment's central premise -
  that "cost-only" fallback reasons are always pure cost proxies with no
  remaining semantic risk - was wrong for the majority of reasons
  tested.** There is no shortcut to 100% coverage via blind bulk
  relaxation; each of the 16 confirmed-unsafe reasons needs the same
  per-shape forced-correctness investigation (`mir_is_profiled_*`
  predicates, forced-accept A/B) that produced the safe subsets already
  in production. Real, safe progress was still made (+108/+110,
  crossing 50%), but the "fast path to 100%" the pivot hoped for does not
  exist without this per-reason correctness work.
- **T435 changes the architecture priority:** the generic
  `cfg-backedge` bucket itself is now exhausted and no longer appears in
  either census. The known-open interpreter/VLA loop failures remain, but
  under their actual current reasons (`selector`, `boolean-phi-cost`,
  `unary-not-cost`, `dynamic-index-base-cost`,
  `binary-load-pair-cost`, and `dead-store-forwarding-cost`). Continue
  with those higher-yield reason populations rather than reopening a
  nonexistent generic backedge bucket.
- **T436 materially reduces the second-largest unsafe reason:** a blind
  post-T435 force still failed 12 apps, and forced-function bisection
  identified 10 individually wrong backedge candidates. A 63-function
  semantically eligible slice exposed two additional combination-only
  issues. Broadly enabling the existing strict-PHI retry fixed `tchess`
  but miscompiled `tatof.chk_inf` and `tctxflt.truth_or`, so that
  experiment was reverted and label-only fallthrough remains excluded.
  `pint` also proved the full-I/O linked image can run out of CP/M memory
  when one MIR function grows by more than 2 KiB, motivating the explicit
  growth ceiling. These are correctness/resource boundaries, not
  performance policy.
- **T437 crosses 60% in one architecture batch.** Full-reason forcing
  still failed nine ordinary apps plus extended test 00158. Per-function
  bisection isolated five individually unsafe shapes:
  `tm1mu.mulmod` (wide specialized arithmetic semantics), `ts32.main`
  (oversized/call-heavy), `tbug.swfc` and `tsvbuf2.expect_prefix`
  (backedges), and `tvla.vla_goto_out` (VLA+backedge). Excluding those
  semantic/resource strata yields a 149-function ordinary cohort that is
  clean even in combination. Continue by attacking the remaining
  backedge/VLA/wide/large text-size strata separately, not by widening
  this proven boundary.
- **T438 crosses 67% by fixing, then opening, the wide stratum.**
  `tm1mu.mulmod` now uses the same overflow-safe `__m1mu` ABI as legacy.
  The bounded acyclic wide cohort adds 137 more ordinary functions after
  that single-function fix. The failed `pihex.powermod16` experiment is a
  standing rule: fusion may only add uses already represented in MIR
  liveness, and skipping an instruction must consume any planned real-
  stack handoff it would have consumed.
- **T439 establishes true-final-reason discipline.** New coverage gates
  that intend to classify the terminal fallback reason must run after
  every retry, immediately before `emitted = 0`. The older policy block
  is earlier than boolean simplification, block CSE, address
  rematerialization, and phi-slot retries; accepting there can select a
  transient candidate whose final classified reason is different.
- **T440 applies that discipline to dynamic index bases.** The landed
  cohort runs at the actual final decision point and combines semantic
  guards (acyclic/no label-PHI/VLA/inline/pointer-array), a 2 KiB growth
  cap, and a 5,000-byte absolute CP/M resource cap. Remaining candidates
  are primarily backedge/wide or later-retry strata.
- **T441 confirms the shared bounded-acyclic boundary generalizes.** The
  same semantic/resource predicate safely admits a second reason without
  duplicating policy formulas; keep using a shared helper when later
  reasons need the identical boundary.
- **T442 produces the largest shared-predicate reuse so far (+35).** It
  also re-confirms that blind reason forcing can fail solely because it
  intercepts a transient pre-retry candidate; terminal-reason testing is
  the authoritative production model.
- **T443 adds a reason-specific frame-pressure stratum.** The common
  bounded-acyclic predicate remains the base; `wide-store-cost` further
  requires a call-containing measured shape because its only call-free
  member triggers a stack-check resource failure in pint.
- **T444 validates the batch-of-10 operating model directly.** Four
  independently measured small cohorts were combined into one 27-function
  commit and one pre-publication full extended gate. The shared predicate
  now covers seven final reasons with one source of truth.
- **T445 preserves that cadence while enforcing no-removal discipline.**
  The first five-reason experiment gained 22 but lost two existing MIR
  functions; the final four-reason batch gains 15 with zero removals and
  excludes both identified bad strata.
- **T446 closes a real representation bug, not a gate symptom.** MIR now
  records when a dereference consumed a pointer-array dimension, so
  deferred metadata repair uses element stride rather than restoring the
  whole-array stride. `(*ip)[i]`, `(*cp)[i]`, `(*pp)[i]`, and
  `(*lp)[i]` now use 2/1/2/35 rather than 8/4/6/105.
- **T447 eliminates the selector-less bucket.** Every former
  selector rejection was the same unresolved `#itmpN` store. Synthetic
  inline temps remain excluded from SSA promotion but are now published
  as frame memory. One nested-lifetime collision is explicitly gated;
  every other function reaches a real selector/cost decision.
- **T448 fixes the first shared loop-state root cause.** Slot planning and
  emission now share one `mir_value_requires_phi_slot()` predicate, so a
  value needed by an edge copy cannot be optimized into a branch-only
  handoff. This removes four prior boolean-loop failure apps and makes
  binary-load loop forcing clean outside the known pint resource case.
- **T449 nearly eliminates the historical dominant text-size bucket.**
  After T448, full reason forcing failed only transient pint resource
  selection and oversized `ts32.main`; true-final ordering plus a
  10,000-byte ceiling safely admits every other terminal candidate.
- **T450 crosses 80% and fixes nested inline temp allocation.** The live
  temp mask had been restored after AST cloning but before lowering, so
  nested calls reused an outer slot. Scope now spans lowering, causing
  nested expansion to choose `#itmp2` instead of overwriting `#itmp1`.
- **T451 crosses 83% with reason-specific loop admission.** The earlier
  acyclic dynamic cohort and this scalar loop cohort together remove 57
  functions while preserving wide/backedge and label-PHI failure strata.
- **T452 demonstrates why extended coverage remains mandatory.** The
  standard 314 apps passed the proposed phi-fallthrough loop stratum, but
  extended `00183` failed. Only the independently clean boolean/unary
  strata landed.
- **T453 closes the safe wide index/store strata.** Dynamic wide
  candidates remain bounded at 10 KiB with no label/VLA/pointer/inline
  shape; wide stores extend to 10 KiB only when acyclic and
  call-containing.
- **T454 eliminates terminal wide-constant fallback.** It also proves the
  small VLA dynamic-index functions are correctness-clean after PHI and
  pointer metadata repair.
- **T455 eliminates terminal PHI-fallthrough fallback.** Consecutive labels
  are aliases, not CFG edges; the real predecessor owns each copy, while
  NOP-only arms defer to the branch entry copy. The same batch fixes typed
  signedness/narrowing aliases and fused constant operands exposed by broad
  PHI admission.
- **T456 opens the repaired bounded boolean-PHI stratum.** The broad
  66-function reason reaches 91% but still fails eight apps; exact-function
  isolation identified direct failures in `ShowBinaryData`, `MinMax`,
  `factor_call_or_var`, `run_at`, and `parse_source`, plus multi-function
  interpreter/resource interactions. The call-containing <=20-block cohort
  is independently full-extended clean.
- **T457 opens the repaired small unary-not stratum.** All remaining terminal
  unary candidates at <=6 blocks/6 KiB pass together, including parser lookup,
  I/O, chess, and type-test functions.
- **T458 nearly eliminates dead-local suffix fallback.** Twenty-three wide,
  label-PHI, loop, float, and pointer candidates pass together; only one
  45-block/one-call shape remains.
- **T459 eliminates terminal absolute-index fallback.** The two failures from
  blind reason forcing were later-retry candidates with different true final
  reasons, confirming final-reason ordering is again load-bearing.
- **T460 nearly eliminates wide-store fallback.** Eighteen loop and large
  acyclic candidates pass together; two precisely isolated shapes remain.
- **T461 eliminates terminal indirect-store-address fallback.** Eleven
  attention, allocator, loop, and narrowing candidates pass together.
- **T462 eliminates terminal planned-index-base fallback.** Eleven true-final
  candidates pass without the nonlocal label/layout perturbations caused by
  blind transient interception.
- **T463 eliminates terminal planned-stack fallback.** Seven true-final
  candidates pass while `tlimits` retains its actual boolean-PHI reason.
- **T464 consolidates two tiny residuals.** Constant-home is reduced to one
  direct call-free failure; dead-store forwarding is fully eliminated.
- **T465 closes instruction-count and halves binary-load-pair.** True-final
  gating avoids the two selector removals seen under blind forcing.
- **T466 reduces block-CSE to two direct failures.** Four large single-block
  functions pass their true CSE candidates in both modes.
- **T467 separates deterministic and drifting sinks.** FINAL-sink unary
  functions are safe; VERIFY/DEFERRED static bodies can select different
  final reasons and require an architectural determinism fix.
- **T468 crosses 95% ordinary.** Seven FINAL boolean functions pass after
  excluding two direct failures, all four-call candidates, and high-block
  non-wide pairwise interactions.
- **T469 isolates deterministic FINAL dynamic indexes.** Nine functions pass;
  three direct standard failures and extended `00182` remain excluded.
- **T470 resolves most static unary residue.** Guarded literal-final
  diagnostics expose mode-specific failures correctly; 19 static bodies pass
  both peep modes together.
- **T471 halves the dynamic-index residue.** Seven static/FINAL candidates
  pass both modes; seven individually confirmed failures remain.
- **T472 crosses 98% stack-check coverage.** Individual full-mode
  classification plus a three-function/8-KiB module budget admits 26 boolean
  functions without interpreter layout exhaustion.
- **T473 crosses 98% ordinary coverage.** A one-per-module cap safely adds one
  larger COBOL unary function; admitting all three peers fails.
- **T474 safely expands ordinary module budgets.** A ten-function ceiling
  remains bounded by 8 KiB, adding four `forint` functions without reopening
  `adaint`, `cint`, or COBOL limits.
- **T475 fixes helper-call allocation.** Values live across `/` or `%` can no
  longer remain in caller-clobbered HL/DE/BC.
- **T476 eliminates inline-temp-overlap fallback.** Sequential slot reuse is
  distinguished from genuine nested identity overwrite.
- **T477 eliminates inline-substitution fallback.** dccpeep can no longer
  borrow IY in a callee when MIR retains a caller value there.
- **T478 fixes formatted-I/O EXTRN ownership.** Calls sharing one source
  symbol can resolve to distinct assembler entry points; direct-call EXTRNs
  are now deduplicated by that resolved name, admitting `tpfauto.main`.
- **T479 eliminates terminal text-size fallback.** The T455 typed-alias fixes
  already repaired `ts32.main`; the final non-speculative sink now admits its
  oversized shift matrix after every retry has completed.
- **T480 completes empty-arm PHI ownership.** An explicit branch can target an
  earlier label in a NOP/label-only alias chain; matching only the final alias
  emitted the edge copy twice and overwrote the selected value. The complete
  empty span now identifies the real owner, admitting `tabsidm.main`,
  `cobint.parse_data_line`, and `forint.decode_stmts`.
- **T481 reopens two repaired dynamic-index strata.** The three-call
  label-PHI function and a bounded non-wide allocator loop both pass full
  mode after T480; the five wide/interpreter/resource failures remain gated.
- **T484 publishes spilled virtual-IY ownership and emits both conditional
  edge copies.** This admits `cobint.parse_source`; `pint.factor_call_or_var`
  is semantically fixed in peep mode but remains gated by nopeep TPA pressure.
- **T485 fixes paired div/mod storage.** Both quotient and remainder now own
  simultaneous concrete slots, preventing a quotient restore from
  invalidating a slotless remainder marker; `fint.run_at` is admitted.
- **T486 makes MinMax transforms transactional and word-correct.** Packed
  frame/call rewrites commit only when both recursive and external call sites
  match, and the shared epilogue restores H for the declared byte return.
- **T487 closes the bounded four-call FINAL stratum.** The two remaining
  <=36-block/10-KiB functions pass both modes after the PHI and ownership
  repairs; larger and low-call resource failures remain gated.
- **T488 admits the repaired bounded float loop.** `xsinf` is semantically
  correct after the branch fixes and passes both modes with a tracked
  544-byte stack reserve instead of disabling stack checking.
- **T489 crosses 99% in both censuses.** The high-boolean-simplification
  parser is admitted with a tracked 768-byte stack reserve; this is explicit
  Phase-1 resource debt for the post-100% frame-recovery campaign.
- **T490 reduces dynamic-index residue to four.** The deterministic
  13-block/19-call FINAL float driver passes both modes with T488's tracked
  reserve and no longer needs its historical exclusion.
- **T491 eliminates terminal block-CSE fallback.** Aggregate call arguments
  now use correctly directed `LDIR`, and scalar results survive odd-byte stack
  cleanup in forced concrete slots. `tstructv.main` shrinks by about 8 KiB
  and passes both modes.
- **T492 repairs mixed unsigned division.** MIR's inline `/ power-of-two`
  strength reduction corrupted the following runtime quotient in a mixed
  sequence despite passing alone. Division now stays on the normal helper
  path while modulo masking remains; `tmodp2.main` is admitted.
- **T493 adds bounded hybrid retained-home emission.** The existing homed CFG
  backend now supports the required wide homes, frame accesses, arithmetic,
  indexing, and spills transactionally for final boolean residue. It admits
  `pint.next`, `scan_string`, and `skip_brace_comment`.
- **T494 eliminates terminal wide-store fallback.** The hybrid emitter's
  general wide-helper path now handles the zero-spill, three-block division
  CFG and emits `pint.calc_code_limit` smaller than legacy.
- **T495 halves unary-not residue.** The hybrid retry admits only acyclic,
  non-inline, <=40-block/7-call unary candidates, selecting
  `cobint.compile_add` and `compile_subtract` while preserving
  `fint.top_level`.
- **T496 eliminates terminal binary-load-pair fallback.** Alias-safe
  block-local reuse retains `code` and `cp` across the three `code[cp]` field
  stores in `pint.emit`; the retry is isolated to its two-block/one-call
  reason so established one-block selectors remain unchanged.
- **T497 fixes shadowed object-merge types.** Deferred alias repair retargeted
  a merge from an outer `int` to a C99 for-init `long` without updating its
  type, truncating the loop PHI and hanging `tforsco.main`.
- **T498 opens the measured larger hybrid stratum.** Hybrid emission supports
  up to seven spills and 92-block call/PHI CFGs with a 25% Phase-1 size bound,
  admitting the final COB performer and Fortran parser.
- **T499 adds real call-boundary live-range splitting.** Persistent regional
  segments reuse caller-saved homes and spill slots between calls; stable
  parameters/addresses rematerialize at use. `pint.subprog` now fits the
  stack-check TPA and passes both modes. Its two-block peer remains fallback
  because selecting both perturbs Pint's optimized linked layout.
- **T503 resolves the giant-switch outlier without widening regional homes.**
  `a1.emulate` has low live pressure and arm-local state; T499's 458 tiny
  regions produced only one-use spill segments and grew the candidate.
  Recovering the 153-case unsigned-byte dispatch as a PHI-free 256-entry jump
  table cuts the final candidate to 31,946 bytes / 2,540 instructions and
  admits it under a measured FINAL-void structural gate.
- **T432 (this segment): n-gram re-mining re-confirms text-size/
  boolean-phi-cost exhaustion, no code change.** Re-ran the T385 n-gram
  mining tool against the current, much more mature populations
  (`text-size` 304 candidates, `boolean-phi-cost` 158) to check whether
  all the architecture work since T385 (T393-T431) had shifted anything
  into a newly mineable shape. Result: no. `boolean-phi-cost`'s only
  idiom (materialize-then-retest boolean, ~866 occurrences) is still
  dominated by the same `a1.op_bcd_math`/`a1.op_math` pair T385 already
  forced-accept-tested and correctly rejected. `text-size`'s top n-grams
  are exclusively generic ABI-mandated calling-convention boilerplate
  (multi-arg call cleanup, frame setup, word-from-frame reloads) spread
  across ~108 distinct apps with no >=10-function cohort left uncovered
  by an existing (already-exhausted) selector concept - re-confirming
  T385's original "genuinely heterogeneous, no dominant fixable idiom"
  finding rather than contradicting it. Both gate-margin mining
  (T394-T431, 9+ buckets) and n-gram idiom mining are now confirmed
  exhausted against the current corpus. Full details: `## Item T432` in
  `mir-text-size-plan.md`. Coverage unchanged: 914/2026, 936/2128.
- **Post-T429 re-rank (this segment)**: a fresh gate-margin re-rank across
  every remaining bucket confirmed gate-margin mining is now exhausted
  project-wide, again. `fint.top_level` (`unary-not-cost`, 26-block CFG,
  better static bytes/instructions than legacy but rejected by the
  `mir_cfg_block_count() > 18` defensive cap) looked like a promising
  near-miss on first read, but a direct forced-accept full-mode A/B
  **regressed real performance** (peep bytes 28288->28544, peep cycles
  +198, nopeep cycles +1224) despite the favorable static metrics -
  confirming the block-count cap is load-bearing, not overly
  conservative. Also re-confirmed the `mir-gate-margins.py` script sorts
  by **instruction count**, not bytes - its top `text-size` candidates
  (`tvla.vla_nested`, `tvla.vla_long_bound`, etc.) look like near-misses
  on instructions but are actually **worse on bytes** (e.g.
  `vla_nested`: 264 fewer instructions but 3028 vs 2923 bytes, +105/+3.6%
  worse) - not real leads. No code change; recorded in
  `mir-dead-ends.tsv`. Coverage unchanged: 914/2026, 936/2128.
- **Stream J (this segment): T430/T431, real block-cse-cost architecture
  landed, +0/+0 coverage.** Dispatched to attempt T407's identified
  architectural blocker for `block-cse-cost` (a genuine
  retained/rematerialized base-address planner). Mid-flight, discovered
  and relayed to the agent that an earlier stream (Stream G) had already
  landed a closely related, more advanced attempt as `## Item T426`
  (allocator-aware kill-tracked block VN - proved the bucket isn't
  blocked on missing equality/kill reasoning, but on the spilled
  backend's habit of manufacturing new frame/stack-slot traffic for a
  reused value, which `dccpeep` cannot fold as well as its existing
  direct-reload-from-global pattern; also found the legacy same-block
  CSE retry poisons spill pressure before a later VN pass can help).
  Redirected Stream J to build on T426's precise diagnosis rather than
  re-deriving it. Result, independently re-verified from scratch in the
  main repo against a freshly-regenerated true baseline (not any cached
  snapshot): **ordinary 914/2026 -> 914/2026, stack-check 936/2128 ->
  936/2128, exactly +0/+0**, zero selector changes, zero selected-output
  hash changes across both censuses, zero apps requiring runtime
  validation, forced-correctness 7/7, full extended gate 314/323/0
  failed. Landed two real commits: **T430** implements the missing
  physical-home distinction for block-CSE retries - address
  rematerialization no longer stops at a single root `MIR_ADDRESS`, it
  now recursively rematerializes multi-use named address chains
  (`MIR_MEMBER_ADDRESS`/constant-index `MIR_INDEX_ADDRESS` chains) during
  same-block CSE retries so a reused address chain can stay "no home
  needed" instead of forcing a new slot. This changes only rejected
  candidate metrics (32 apps improved on raw generated bytes/instructions,
  e.g. `a1.op_pop_pf` 1336->1257 bytes) with the selected/shipped output
  byte-identical everywhere - a genuine T400/T402/T403/T406/T410/T411/
  T429-style zero-net architectural enabler. A provisional promotion
  gate (admit one-block address-only spilled candidates that are
  no-worse on raw metrics and don't raise spill/move counts) was tried
  and correctly reverted: it picked up 2 candidates
  (`tfarrsub.set_intvec`, `wumpus.stats`) that both regressed full-mode
  performance despite passing the static bar, alongside one genuinely
  clean isolated winner (`a1.op_pop_pf`, confirmed via direct
  forced-accept A/B) that could not be promoted without a general,
  non-name-based predicate separating it from its own structural
  siblings. **T431** is a sharper, decisive double-confirmation
  follow-on: a transactional pre-legacy-retry VN pass does let
  `cobint.compile_stmt` clear the gate on pristine MIR, but the surviving
  representation still manufactures a 4-byte IX frame that regresses
  peep size identically to T426's original finding; tightening to a
  slotless-only slice removes the regression but also collapses back to
  zero admissions. Confirms `block-cse-cost` needs one of: (1) a
  genuinely cheaper spilled/backend home strategy that beats
  `dccpeep`'s existing direct-reload folding for reused values, or (2) a
  fuller selector-local replacement for the historical retry that can
  choose among transformed variants without being stuck in the same
  frame-caching representation. Both are still open, real, multi-session
  architecture items for a future stream - not gate-margin mining
  material. Full details: `## Item T430`/`## Item T431` in
  `mir-text-size-plan.md`.
- Latest production cohort: T427, real fallback-only phi-return
  forwarding for label-only fallthrough joins (+5/+5), closing the
  `phi-fallthrough-cost` architecture lead. Prior cohort: T425, cheap
  direct-home path for objectless
  single-use pointer parameters (+1/+1), resolving the T424 cost-model
  gap. Prior cohort: T405, call-result direct-reload narrow
  `storeind` (Stream B) - +2/+2 coverage, landed alongside T400
  (Stream D's MIR-only scalar address-escape filter, +3/+3), T403
  (Stream C's centralized named-address resolver + field-aware CSE,
  +1/+1), and T402/T406/T410/T411 (four zero-net architectural
  enablers: direct-reload wide storeind path, phi-slot spill/reload
  cleanup for large-gap backedges, planned store-address handoff
  extended across one same-block call, and an address-rematerialization
  retry that shrank `planned-index-base-cost` 38->19 ordinary). This
  "next 20%" wave's 4-stream parallel execution (foreground correctness
  stream + 3 background implementation agents, one integrator) found
  real wins early but has hit a strong, repeated dead-end pattern in
  its most recent rounds: `block-cse-cost` needs a selector-local MIR
  rollback or a real retained/rematerialized base planner (not another
  bounded VN extension - T407), `inline-substitution` needs TU-wide
  callee materialization or true MIR-native inlining, `phi-fallthrough-
  cost`, `wide-store-cost` (T408) and a fresh `unary-not-cost` re-rank
  (T412) all show no safe generalizable predicate, and Stream D's
  `text-size`/`indirect-store-address-cost`/`rhs-stack-cost` follow-up
  on its own T410 infrastructure found 0/12 clean in `rhs-stack-cost`.
  A full sweep of `mir-dead-ends.tsv` found **15 confirmed correctness
  bugs** logged project-wide under forced admission (all safely excluded
  by existing gates in production - none currently reachable). Root-cause
  investigation (T413) found and fixed a genuine miscompilation: T410's
  call-crossing planned-stack store-address path had a push/pop ordering
  bug in `dcc_mir_spilled_cfg.c` (`MIR_STORE_INDIRECT`'s call-crossing
  case popped the call-result value where the planned address should have
  been popped, and vice versa), corrupting memory whenever that exact
  shape was force-admitted. Fixed with a 4-line reorder; zero net
  coverage change (the path was unreachable in production - a latent
  risk, not a shipped bug). **Scenario-complete re-validation (T415)
  corrected T413's scope**: only **5 of the 7** originally-tested
  functions are genuinely fully fixed across every scenario each app
  declares (`bint.add_string`, `forint.add_stmt`, `tallocx.fill`,
  `too.bst_insert`, `attnc11.convert_weight_group`); the other 2
  (`adaint.var_or_const_decl`, `forint.run_prog`) only had their
  default-scenario symptom fixed - both still fail differently on their
  `ttt`/`sieve` extra scenarios, confirming a **second, separate,
  still-unfixed bug** shared with `tvapinit.join`/`tap.first_implementation`
  (a suspected hidden-phi-edge-use defect in forward-to-next/slot
  elision, per Stream B's independent lead - not yet root-caused).
  Status: **5/15 confirmed bugs fully resolved, at least 4/15 confirmed
  still open under one shared (not yet fixed) second mechanism, ~6/15 not
  yet re-tested against the T413 fix.** Active investigation continues in
  parallel with T414 (Stream C's `absolute-index-cost` rematerialization
  retry, 0 net coverage, real enabler) and continued mining of untried
  buckets (`dead-local-suffix-cost`, text-size re-bucketing).
- Earlier cohort: T396, signed wide-constant relational inline
  compare - ported legacy's `emit_signed_long_const_cmp_ast` exactly
  (sign-flip + biased 32-bit `sbc` sequence) as MIR's own inline codegen
  for a wide relational compare against a compile-time constant on the
  right operand, replacing the always-call-the-runtime-helper path for
  this shape. Found and fixed a real redundant-load pitfall in the
  caller (6 wasted bytes/call site) via a full-census diff before
  landing - the naive version passed all 5 forced-accept tests but
  regressed `tlongreg.test_compares` corpus-wide. +5 ordinary/+5
  stack-check, zero removals; focused full-mode validation on
  `tlong,tlongopt,tlongreg` clean (10 improvements incl. `tlongreg`
  peep -19.56% cycles); full extended gate clean (0 regressions, 408
  improvements). This closes the item T394 had explicitly scoped but
  deferred, and was `plan.md`'s top-ranked remaining architecture lead.
- Prior finding: T397, exhaustive `wide-constant-cost` re-testing after
  T396 shrank the bucket to 41 - found 12 more real clean wins (two
  large: `tpromo.test_integer_promotions` -8.99% bytes, `tlong.tshft`
  -10.13% bytes) but again **no safe generalizable threshold** separates
  them from 26 confirmed regressions at identical byte margins
  (`too.rect_perim`/`tctxops.sh_udiv` both margin +6, one regresses one
  wins). No code change; all 38 tested candidates recorded in
  `mir-dead-ends.tsv`. This bucket is now considered exhausted for
  gate-margin mining, matching T395's three buckets and T394's
  `unary-not-cost`.
- Latest production cohort: T394, unsigned wide-constant relational
  compares (`u_gtbig`/`u_lebig`-style) - legacy has no inline shortcut for
  unsigned wide relational compares against a constant either (it also
  calls `__ltu`/`__leu`/`__gtu`/`__geu`), so MIR's identical call-based
  codegen is call-for-call equivalent; the `wide-constant-cost` gate now
  admits this proven-safe shape on an instruction-count guard instead of
  requiring a strictly smaller byte count. +2 ordinary/+2 stack-check,
  zero removals, focused full-mode and full extended gates clean.
- Latest production cohort: T391, `branch-condition-cost`'s block-count arm
  narrowed from an unconditional `blocks > 2` to `blocks > 2 &&
  captured_instructions > 50` after full-mode A/B found the rejected
  multi-block population splits cleanly: `bint.compile_line` (27 legacy
  instructions) is a clean win, every other measured multi-block candidate
  (95-421 legacy instructions) regresses. +1 ordinary/+1 stack-check, zero
  removals, focused full-mode and full extended gates clean.
- T388 (prior cohort): `rematerialized-home-cost` calls==0 measured cohort
  (`mir_is_profiled_rematerialized_home_measured_cohort`, admits call-free
  single-block pointer/struct-member compound-assignment forms despite a
  positive raw instruction delta), +4 ordinary/+4 stack-check.
- **T389/T390/T391 exhaustively re-ranked 12 fallback buckets this segment
  and found the per-bucket near-miss vein is now sharply diminishing-return:**
  only T388 (+4) and T391 (+1) yielded real, safely-generalizable landable
  wins; every other bucket investigated (`dynamic-index-base-cost`,
  `block-cse-cost`, `absolute-address-cost`, `planned-stack-cost`,
  `lazy-parameter-cost`, `indirect-store-address-cost`,
  `indirect-store-stack-cost`) either confirmed more correctness bugs (10
  total found this segment, all currently harmless since gated off for
  unrelated reasons - see `mir-dead-ends.tsv`) or found real winners with
  **no safe generalizable predicate** (structurally identical candidates
  land on both sides of win/loss; call-count or instruction-count
  thresholds are frequently non-monotonic per-bucket). T390 additionally
  pinpointed a precise architectural lead: `absolute-address-cost`'s
  repeated `index*N` computation is not an indexaddr-CSE gap but a
  call-side-effect/aliasing analysis gap (repeated `loadind` of a global
  struct member cannot safely be reused across intervening opaque calls
  without proving the callee doesn't write back to it) - materially
  higher-risk/higher-effort than originally scoped. **Recommendation:**
  further material coverage gains now require either (a) the
  call-effect/aliasing analysis project just described, or (b) the
  `phi-fallthrough-cost` architecture fix (T384's phi-forwarding-across-
  labels lead, needed to unlock `tinline.edge_and`/`edge_conditional` and
  likely others in that 44-function bucket), rather than continued
  per-bucket near-miss mining.
- **T386 was reverted (see T387 in `mir-text-size-plan.md`).** A stale local
  `ntvcm` build undercounted `LD SP,HL` by 1 T-state all session, producing
  illusory double-digit "improvements" for MIR-heavy hot loops. CI caught a
  real (tiny) `forint (peep)` regression from T386 that every local
  measurement had missed; the local emulator has been rebuilt from
  `origin/main` and the offending commit reverted (`629df33`). The corrected-
  emulator full extended gate is clean at the reverted state (T384's
  numbers). Before trusting any cycle-count claim going forward, confirm the
  local `ntvcm` binary is current (`git fetch && git log HEAD..origin/main`
  should be empty) - CI always builds fresh and remains authoritative.
- New tooling: `scripts/mir-gate-margins.py`, a generic per-reason-bucket
  near-miss ranker consuming the existing census TSV (no per-gate formula
  duplication). Used to find the T384 near-misses; re-run after every
  architectural change to re-rank remaining populations.
- New tooling: `scripts/mir-mac-ngram-miner.py`, a generic n-gram miner for
  the two largest heterogeneous fallback populations (`text-size`,
  `boolean-phi-cost`). T385 used it to confirm the quick-win vein is mined
  out for now: `text-size`'s top idioms are generic calling-convention/
  prologue boilerplate (no single fixable pattern), and `boolean-phi-cost`'s
  real `ld hl,N/jp/ld hl,N/or l/jp z` idiom occurs in functions too large
  (33+ blocks) for MIR's own naive rendering to beat yet. Both automation
  tools are ready to re-run after the next architectural change.
- New tooling: `scripts/mir-forced-accept-batch.py`, a concurrent
  forced-accept full-mode A/B runner (one `runall.ps1` subprocess per
  `(app, function)` candidate, unique scratch build dir each, `ntvcm`
  freshness preflight) that turns what used to be N sequential manual
  A/B round trips into one batched command. `mir-dead-ends.tsv` is a
  checked-in ledger of confirmed non-wins (correctness bugs and perf
  regressions) with `(app, function, reason, delta, note, source)`
  columns; `mir-gate-margins.py --exclude-known mir-dead-ends.tsv` filters
  a fresh near-miss ranking against it so already-answered candidates are
  never re-investigated. T388 used both together to invalidate a
  pre-planned candidate list in minutes instead of one-at-a-time
  investigation, and to find its real win via a fast re-rank.

| milestone | ordinary target | gain from current |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 45% | 912 | +17 |
| 50% | 1,013 | +118 |
| 55% | 1,115 | +220 |
| 60% | 1,216 | +321 |

The ordinary whole-corpus census is the primary metric. Stack-check is a
mandatory secondary regression guard, not an alternate denominator.

## Immediate next steps

**Phase 1 is complete: 100% MIR coverage achieved.** Ordinary
2060/2060 (100.00%), stack-check 2179/2179 (100.00%), pushed as commit
`e5cb8d0`. Zero fallback functions of any kind remain in the standard
corpus. Full extended gate clean (314/314 runnable + 196/196 extended +
diagnostics + dccpeep), independently re-verified at integration.

**How the final six functions landed**, all building on the same
call-bounded regional-home architecture (T499) but requiring two further
real architectural extensions, not just wider caps:
- `pint.subprog`, `pint.for_stmt`, `adaint.next` (T499, T501, T502):
  call-boundary live-range splitting, then a wide-value loop class.
- `a1.emulate` (T503) and `pint.run` (T505): a *different* insight -
  large flat dispatch switches (354 blocks / 43-153 cases) have low live
  pressure and mostly arm-local state, so region splitting alone made
  them *worse* by adding boundary-copy overhead with no real slot-reuse
  benefit. The real fix recognized MIR's equality-chain lowering of a
  dense unsigned-byte switch as a recoverable jump-table identity
  (matching what the legacy AST backend already emitted natively) and
  fused the dispatch epilogue.
- `pint.factor_call_or_var`, `pint.scan_number` (T504): extended regional
  homes to mixed-width/object-backed segments (reusing object-backed PHI
  slots, allocating overlapping narrow/wide regional segments).

**A validation lesson from this integration, worth repeating**: when
multiple agents work in parallel worktrees sharing this repo's git object
store and a single shared `git stash` list, always check stash labels
before applying by index (indices shift across worktrees), and always
`git stash` any *other* uncommitted work-in-progress before running
`-UpdatePerfBaseline` in a shared worktree - leaving unrelated diagnostic/
experimental code in place during a baseline measurement produced a
spurious ~30% "cycle improvement" reading on two unrelated apps that had
nothing to do with the actual change being measured. Conversely, do not
assume every large performance swing is contamination: T505's real,
verified swings (`cint` -43%, `cobint` -29%, `adaint` -34% nopeep cycles)
were confirmed genuine via independent direct measurement (raw `ntvcm -p`
runs reproducing the same order-of-magnitude reduction with correct
output) - the generic postincrement-store/self-store-add fusion added for
`pint.run` directly benefits the bignum-arithmetic loops shared by every
arbitrary-precision interpreter in the corpus (`cint`, `cobint`, `adaint`,
`fint`, `forint`, `bint`).

## Phase 2: performance recovery (now active)

The goal is bringing the complete corpus back to at/below the published
pre-MIR performance baseline (`45cf3f0`), since Phase 1 deliberately accepted
tracked regressions to reach 100% coverage quickly.

T506-T510 completed the focused Pint/a1 recovery: Pint beats its pre-MIR
references in both modes; a1 is within 0.33% peep and 0.81% faster nopeep than
its immediate pre-T503 baseline.

T511 completes the first whole-corpus concentration batch. `dccprof` and
one-function fallback attribution proved `tbig` was 76.8% of all positive
peep debt, dominated by wide arithmetic whose results were demanded only as
bytes. Demand-driven byte-loop, byte-lane, byte-pack, masked-zero branch, and
wide increment identities reduce:

- `tbig` peep **19,493,936,425 -> 1,462,690,127 (-92.50%)**;
- `tbig` nopeep **20,408,476,105 -> 1,428,152,252 (-93.00%)**.

This is now 1.34% faster peep and 61.90% faster nopeep than pre-MIR. Shared
wins include `fileops` (-58% to -60%), `tlmul` (-26% to -28%), `tm1mu`
(-6%), and ten smaller apps. Positive pre-MIR peep debt falls from 23.451B
to 5.409B cycles (-76.9%). Both censuses remain 100%; the full extended gate
is clean.

T512 recovers 42-case 16-bit interpreter dispatch and narrow-origin wide
arithmetic. Fint improves 54.9% peep / 52.5% nopeep; attnc11 improves 36.9% /
34.9%. The same signed/unsigned 16x16 specialization improves `pihex`,
`tm1mu`, `tlongopt`, `tbufex`, and `trw2`. Positive pre-MIR peep debt is now
4.333B cycles (-81.5% cumulatively from the initial 23.451B), with both
censuses and the full extended gate clean.

T513 recovers `cpi` byte-verification loops and symmetric zero-left equality
branches. `tm` improves 83.7% peep / 85.2% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR in
both modes. Shared zero-test wins improve `ttt`, `trw2`, `trwold`, `tcpirlp`,
`a1`, and smaller apps. Positive pre-MIR peep debt is now 3.727B cycles
(-84.1% cumulatively), with both censuses and the full extended gate clean.

T514 recovers zero-terminated word scans plus large-CFG dynamic global
indexing and in-place narrow PHI adjustments. `tstr` improves 29.6% peep /
37.0% nopeep and `trw2` improves 16.3% / 20.1%; both now beat pre-MIR in
both modes. Shared wins include `trwold`, `tforsco`, `cobint`, and 11 smaller
apps. Positive pre-MIR peep debt is now 2.929B cycles (-87.5% cumulatively);
aggregate nopeep cycles are already 413.8M below pre-MIR. Both censuses and
the full extended gate remain clean.

T515 recovers large interpreter dispatch, inline stack pushes, byte-pair
reconstruction, and typed byte/word memory helpers. `bint`, `cobint`,
`adaint`, and `cint` improve 33.8-44.9% peep and 36.4-49.8% nopeep.
Ada/COBOL now beat pre-MIR in both modes; Bint/Cint beat pre-MIR nopeep and
retain only 25-29M peep gaps. Positive pre-MIR peep debt is now 1.743B
(-92.6% cumulatively), with both censuses and the full extended gate clean.

T516 recovers the 10-function byte minimax/winner family and exact unsigned
powermod/unit-fraction kernels. TTT improves 77.8% peep / 79.1% nopeep and
Pihex 19.9% / 22.1%; both now beat pre-MIR in both modes. Positive pre-MIR
peep debt is now 1.258B cycles (-94.6% cumulatively), with both censuses and
the full extended gate clean.

T517 recovers seven exact chess evaluation/attack kernels. Tchess improves
41.2% peep / 45.6% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 6.1% / 13.4%. Positive
pre-MIR peep debt is now 1.035B cycles (-95.6% cumulatively), with both
censuses and the full extended gate clean.

T518 recovers Catalan's fixed long-array copy/divide/add-subtract kernels and
Sieve's complete fixed byte-array loop. Catalan improves 38.2% peep / 39.9%
nopeep and beats pre-MIR in both modes; Sieve improves 80.3% / 82.8% and
retains only a 3.35M peep gap. Positive peep debt is now 688.7M cycles
(-97.1% cumulatively), with both censuses and the full extended gate clean.

T519 recovers Attn's signed long clamp/Q16 conversion, fixed dot product,
shared transposed Q8 multiply, and fused Q/K/V projection kernels. Attn
improves 43.0% peep / 46.3% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 14.4% / 27.5%.
Positive per-app peep debt is now 486.3M cycles (-97.9% cumulatively), while
aggregate peep cycles are 115.9M below pre-MIR. Both censuses and the full
extended gate remain clean.

T520 recovers the remaining interpreter leaders with a bounded small dense
dispatch, an exact typed Fortran assignment kernel, and an exact 42-opcode
Forth VM that keeps its instruction pointer in IY. Fint improves 22.1% peep /
31.4% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 5.1% / 21.1%; Forint improves 10.5% /
12.3%, retaining only a 3.2% peep gap while beating pre-MIR nopeep by 4.0%.
Positive peep debt is now 312.6M cycles (-98.7% cumulatively), aggregate peep
is 309.9M below pre-MIR, and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T521 replaces Trw's hot global byte-verification loop with a CPI scan while
preserving its five-argument diagnostic and failure path. Trw improves 74.4%
peep / 81.2% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 72.0% / 79.8%. Positive peep
debt is 252.6M cycles (-98.9% cumulatively), aggregate peep is 846.3M below
pre-MIR, and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T522 recovers E's byte-narrowed digit recurrence plus MM's shared matrix,
zero-fill, and summation kernels. E improves 61.2% peep / 61.0% nopeep and
MM 25.5% / 27.5%; both now beat pre-MIR in both modes. Positive peep debt is
181.8M cycles (-99.2% cumulatively), aggregate peep is 921.0M below pre-MIR,
and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T523 recovers Bint's complete 30-opcode VM with an IY instruction pointer and
a direct next-free operand-stack pointer. Bint improves 11.4% peep / 26.2%
nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 5.0% / 30.0%. Positive peep debt is 156.3M
cycles (-99.3% cumulatively), aggregate peep is 964.0M below pre-MIR, and
both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T524 recovers Forint's 17-op expression VM with an IY token pointer, direct
evaluation-stack pointer, and a dccpeep-safe register-return pop thunk. Forint
improves another 10.3% peep / 28.1% nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 7.5% /
31.0%. Positive peep debt is 133.5M cycles (-99.4% cumulatively), aggregate
peep is 1.040B below pre-MIR, and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T525 recovers Cint's complete 42-op VM with synchronized IY/integer program
counters and cached Gst stack/frame state. Cint improves 29.5% peep / 37.2%
nopeep and now beats pre-MIR by 24.4% / 47.4%. Positive peep debt is 105.0M
cycles (-99.6% cumulatively), aggregate peep is 1.165B below pre-MIR, and
both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T526 starts the long-tail sweep with exact semantic kernels for NQueens'
three-ray safety test, Tqsort's signed-word insertion oracle, and Tpihexb's
16-bit visit-count loop. They improve 38.8%, 29.8%, and 99.5% peep
respectively, and all three now beat pre-MIR in both modes. The visit-count
algebra preserves the source's wrapped result over the full uint16 domain,
not only the test's documented block-512 contract. Positive peep debt is now
67.5M cycles (-99.7% cumulatively), aggregate peep is 1.243B below pre-MIR,
and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

T527 adds ten exact VLA/file/wide-loop shapes and closes six more apps:
`tvlax`, `tvla`, `fileops`, `tap`, `ln2`, and `tpi`. VLA kernels retain every
dynamic allocation, stack check, and restoration while eliminating only
unobservable fills and guards. A new exact-stream marker also makes every
legacy speculative BC/E/IY and loop-first allocator decline after exact MIR
selection, fixing an ordinary-mode corruption found in `ln2.add`. The
ownership correction exposes six previously hidden ordinary static bodies
and three checked bodies, all MIR, so coverage is now 2066/2066 ordinary and
2182/2182 stack-check. Positive peep debt is 24.1M cycles (-99.9%
cumulatively), aggregate peep is 1.359B below pre-MIR, and both censuses/full
extended remain clean.

T528 normalizes exact-stream ownership across every older exact matcher, then
recovers Sieve's byte mark loop, six signed/unsigned typed condition kernels,
and Ttrig's uint32 factorial plus float exp/log kernels. Review found and fixed
the negative `ab(i + C)` arm (`-i + C`, not `-(i + C)`); full-width edge and
float-bit harnesses are output-identical to forced legacy. Sieve improves
41.3% peep / 41.7% nopeep, `t` improves 81.2% / 82.3%, and Ttrig improves
5.9% / 6.9%. Sieve and `t` beat pre-MIR in both modes; Ttrig's remaining gap
is 1.80M / 1.70M cycles. Exact ownership exposes `catalan.add_signed` in both
censuses with no removals, producing 2067/2067 ordinary and 2183/2183
stack-check coverage. Positive peep debt is 16.3M cycles, aggregate peep is
1.378B below pre-MIR, and both censuses/full extended remain clean.

Next:

1. Run parallel, isolated worktree lanes for spill/wide-result chaining,
   loop/address planning, dccpeep canonical recovery, and performance/cost
   measurement; the main session remains the sole integrator.
2. Target the proven systemic causes: eager IX-slot materialization, lost
   DE:HL helper chaining, missing loop/address registerization, generic call
   staging, and boolean materialization. Exact kernels are containment only.
3. Re-rank after every integrated systemic batch until every positive per-app
   gap is recovered; aggregate parity alone is already achieved.
4. Keep one reusable concept per commit, zero regressions in both modes, and
   run one full `runall.ps1 -Mode full -Extended` immediately before each
   publication.
5. Remove capture/replay only after per-app parity and MIR-required
   extended validation; it remains the shadow oracle during recovery.

**Do not repeat these already-falsified Phase-1 approaches** if similar
temptations arise in Phase 2: broad cost-cap widening without a measured
safe class; whole-function spill coalescing alone; broad retained-address
CSE; test/stack weakening; name-based production exceptions. Historical
context for earlier (now superseded) coverage milestones and abandoned/
falsified approaches from the 44-99% climb is preserved below for
reference.

## Latest production cohort

The current cohort promotes three measured allocator-backed loop strata after
all specialized loop selectors decline: call-containing homed CFG, minimally
framed slotless spilled CFG, and bounded small-frame spilled CFG. Homed
selection publishes its actual frameless decision instead of relying on stale
spilled-selector slot state. The source-local-free leaf-loop invariant remains
load-bearing after a broader prototype re-enabled hidden `tstr.wcsrchr` and
regressed both runtime modes by more than 20%.

## Evidence and lessons

1. Narrow cost exceptions do not scale. After this in-flight cohort, do not
   land another narrow exception unless it unlocks at least ten ordinary
   functions or enables a larger architectural campaign.
2. Smaller raw streams are not proof of improvement. `ttype32.main` removed 59
   instructions but regressed peep cycles and linked size. Every promoted class
   needs affected-app full-mode measurement.
3. Broad profiling changes incumbent streams. Diagnostic controls accept exact
   comma-separated manifests or `*`; production admission remains structural
   and cannot contain app/function names.
4. Failed experiments are removed. The parallel PHI-copy scheduler produced
   zero coverage and has no residual production code.
5. Emitter improvements outrank gate widening. The dynamic-index wide-load fix
   turns two regressions into material wins and also admits a third function.
6. Candidate attempts are isolated. Every feature set starts from fresh MIR,
   feature state, output stream, and label base.
7. Static-body placement is part of correctness. A selector change can alter
   legacy inline decisions even when its Z80 is valid; selected hashes and
   census denominators must remain stable unless that change is deliberate.
8. Residual unused wide slots are not new headroom. The 319-function
   text-size census reproduces the previously rejected one-use wide
   binary-to-unary population.
9. Broad boolean-PHI work is no longer the next batch. All 158 residual
   candidates already simplify at least one valid PHI tree; only seven
   functions have extra-use blockers and seven have nontransparent constant
   edges, below the ten-function campaign threshold.

## Current impact ranking

The current ordinary fallback population is:

| priority | fallback reason | functions |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | text-size | 317 |
| 2 | boolean-phi-cost | 158 |
| 3 | dynamic-index-base-cost | 96 |
| 4 | block-cse-cost | 89 |
| 5 | unary-not-cost | 55 |
| 6 | wide-constant-cost | 48 |
| 7 | inline-substitution | 47 |
| 8 | phi-fallthrough-cost | 44 |
| 9 | planned-index-base-cost | 37 |
| 10 | wide-store-cost | 36 |
| 11 | absolute-index-cost | 30 |
| 12 | dead-local-suffix-cost | 29 |
| 13 | absolute-address-cost | 25 |
| 14 | cfg-backedge | 17 |

(As of T384's homed-scalar-cfg dead-store value elision: 890/2026 [+2],
912/2128 stack-check [+2], zero regressions. `dead-local-suffix-cost` fell
31->29 from the two admitted `tmirfast` functions; the two `absolute-index-
cost` near-misses from T383, `tptrlhs.touch_ptr_to_array_deref` and
`tc89init.main`, remain within four instructions of admission and are still
the next quick-win lead. `scripts/mir-gate-margins.py` is the tool to re-rank
this table after any future architectural change.)

Reasons are the last rejected candidate and overlap conceptually. Campaign
budgets therefore use net census gains, never sums of reason counts.

| campaign | planned net gain |
| --- | ---: |
| Boolean and acyclic control flow | +55 |
| Slots, addresses, CSE, and indexes | +115 |
| Calls, wide values, and systemic text size | +100 |
| Allocator-backed loops, inline substitution, and semantic tail | +58 |
| **Total** | **+328** |

If a campaign exceeds its budget, later risky work shrinks. If it misses, rerun
and re-rank the matrix immediately; do not compensate with function-name
exceptions or weaker performance standards.

## Risk policy

Accelerating the migration means tackling shared allocation, PHI, call, and
loop architecture earlier. It does not mean:

- accepting wrong code or hiding regressions in performance baselines;
- removing a semantic gate before its root cause is fixed;
- allowing a newly emitted function to regress in either runtime mode;
- adding app/function-name logic to production selection;
- combining transforms without independent feature controls and fresh streams.

Each high-risk campaign must be reversible through a feature mask, exact
affected-function manifest, census comparison, and focused runtime cohort.

## Campaign 1: boolean and acyclic control flow

Target cumulative coverage of at least 46%, then continue while this remains
the highest-yield matrix class. Planned remaining gain: **+55**.

1. Reclassify the 158 boolean-PHI, 55 unary-not, and 46 phi-fallthrough
   fallbacks by MIR shape and actual selected retry.
2. Add a MIR canonicalization pass that replaces boolean-value PHIs consumed
   only by a branch with predecessor-edge branches. Preserve PHIs with any
   value consumer.
3. Normalize unary `!`, double negation, and compare-to-zero before selection
   so all selectors consume one boolean representation.
4. Implement edge-aware parallel PHI copies only after the matrix identifies
   a real cyclic-copy population. Do not add frame homes merely to break a
   hypothetical cycle.
5. Strengthen the verifier for PHI predecessor completeness, arity, width, and
   edge dominance before enabling a cohort.
6. Use app-level train/holdout sets and promote only structural classes that
   pass both modes.

Stop after two coherent implementations if net gain remains below ten, and
move to Campaign 2 rather than tuning byte/block thresholds.

The first Batch 45 classification reached that stop condition: the residual
boolean-PHI blockers split into sub-ten-function classes, while the dominant
`non-phi` report consists of ordinary branch conditions rather than missed PHI
trees. Pause this campaign and execute Campaign 2. Return only when a fresh
matrix identifies a reusable ten-function boolean cause.

## Campaign 2: slots, addresses, CSE, and indexes

Target cumulative coverage of at least 52%. Planned gain: **+115**.

1. Start with the 101 `dynamic-index-base-cost` and 89 `block-cse-cost`
   candidates. Classify dynamic indexes by base lifetime, stride, calls,
   slots, and repeated use; classify CSE by eliminated opcode and residual
   frame/register cost.
2. Do not repeat the adjacent-DE dynamic-index handoff, which changed 83 app
   streams and promoted zero functions, or widen the single-block homed CSE
   five-instruction gate, whose rejected population includes measured peep
   regressors.
3. Replace whole-value backend-slot lifetimes with use-position intervals and
   safe splitting around calls.
4. Keep incoming parameters and rematerializable constants/addresses out of
   frame slots until a real clobber interval requires storage.
5. Coalesce representation-identical aliases, PHI copies, and one-definition
   forwards through one shared interference predicate.
6. Centralize symbol-plus-offset resolution across members and index chains.
   Loads, stores, address planning, CSE, and extern emission must use the same
   resolver.
7. Replace speculative block CSE with scoped value numbering that records
   alias class, kills, calls, and use count.
8. Build one index plan choosing retained, rematerialized, absolute, or stack
   bases from liveness and clobber data; retire parallel index heuristics.
9. Validate straight-line, acyclic CFG, call-containing, and aggregate-address
   cohorts independently before broad promotion.

## Campaign 3: calls, wide values, and systemic text size

Target cumulative coverage of at least 57%. Planned gain: **+100**.

1. Replace one-sequence nested-call staging with a call plan containing
   argument evaluation order, prepacked constants, nested results, cleanup
   bytes, specialized ABI eligibility, and clobbers.
2. Forward helper return registers directly to sole consumers when width and
   ABI already match.
3. Rematerialize wide constants and stable addresses by halves at their actual
   uses rather than assigning four-byte frame homes.
4. Select direct absolute and register-pair wide stores before bytewise generic
   indirect stores.
5. Re-bucket residual text-size functions by emitted assembly pattern and work
   only repeated patterns affecting at least ten ordinary functions.
6. Dynamically profile helper-heavy or loop-hot cohorts before promotion.

## Campaign 4: allocator-backed loops, inline substitution, and the semantic tail

Cross **1,216/2,026 (60.02%)**. Planned remaining gain: **+58**.

1. Fix backedge correctness through edge-aware liveness, PHI initialization,
   and loop-carried copies. Add forced-MIR focused coverage for every
   historically miscompiled shape first.
2. Admit loops in strata: one natural loop without calls, one loop with calls,
   then multiple backedges. Keep exact manifests and separate runtime cohorts.
3. Represent static inline substitution as a MIR-level call/inlining decision.
   Start with single-block scalar bodies, then acyclic bodies.
4. Use pointer-array and large-CFG tail work only if needed to cross 60%;
   these remain semantic implementations, never cost-gate bypasses.

Do not remove the legacy emitter at 60%. Continue the same measured process to
100%; removal requires MIR-required mode over runnable and extended corpora.

## Fast migration workflow

### Discovery

Run one ordinary and one stack-check candidate matrix per campaign with 24
compiler processes. Put `.mir`, `.mac`, TSV, logs, and reports under
`/dev/shm`. Rank structural signatures with DuckDB or parallel Python instead
of repeatedly recompiling the corpus.

### Development

1. Build the host compiler after each coherent edit.
2. Run the smallest affected app, then the entire affected-app cohort with
   `runall.ps1 -Mode full -FailFast`.
3. Compare ordinary and stack-check censuses only after a transform is
   functionally complete.
4. Run ASan/UBSan for allocator, CFG, ownership, or candidate-state changes.
5. Remove experiments that miscompile, regress either mode, gain fewer than ten
   ordinary functions after two coherent implementations, or require
   app-specific production logic.

Use approximately two-thirds of affected apps for development and reserve one
third as a holdout. Split by app, not function.

### Commit cadence

- Accumulate roughly ten coherent migration items per commit, or one
  indivisible high-risk architecture change.
- During development use focused full-mode cohorts and censuses; do not spend a
  full extended run on each item.
- There is exactly one `ntvcm` binary on this system, at
  `/home/dave/GitHub/ntvcm/ntvcm` (on `PATH`), built from the `main` branch of
  that repo. Before trusting any cycle-count claim (not pass/fail — see T387
  in `mir-text-size-plan.md`), confirm it is current:
  `git -C /home/dave/GitHub/ntvcm fetch && git -C /home/dave/GitHub/ntvcm log HEAD..origin/main --oneline`
  should print nothing; if it does not, `git -C /home/dave/GitHub/ntvcm pull`
  and rebuild with `./m.sh` before measuring. Do not create ad-hoc copies of
  the binary elsewhere (e.g. `/dev/shm/ntvcm-*`) — a stray stale copy is
  exactly what caused T387's illusory session-long "improvements".
- Immediately before every commit, run exactly one fresh:

  `TMPDIR=/dev/shm pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode full -Extended -RunTimeout 30`

- Do not use `-FailFast` for that gate. Failures-only output is already the
  default.
- Commit only the exact passing revision, include the coverage delta and exact
  promotions in the migration log, and push to
  `origin/perf/unified-regalloc`.
- Always wait for GitHub Actions (`gh run watch <id> --exit-status`) and
  confirm green before starting the next item. CI always builds `ntvcm` fresh
  from `davidly/ntvcm` and is the authoritative source of truth for any
  performance claim — see T387: it caught a real regression that every local
  measurement missed due to a stale local emulator.

## Best-practice constraints

- MIR transforms operate on MIR and metadata; selectors only select and emit.
- One helper owns each invariant: frame cost, address resolution, call
  planning, interval interference, PHI copies, and candidate lifecycle.
- Mutable feature state cannot survive an attempt.
- Semantic gates remain separate from profitability gates.
- Shared analyses have verifier assertions and focused tests.
- Diagnostics are opt-in and silent by default.
- Generated census and matrix files are never committed.
- Preserve unrelated `.vscode/settings.json`, `scripts/runall.ps1`, and
  `_crit/` changes.

## 60% completion criteria

1. Ordinary production MIR coverage is at least **1,216/2,026**.
2. Stack-check coverage has no removal from the current published baseline.
3. Every new or changed active function passes affected-app full mode.
4. The exact final revision passes the full extended pre-commit gate.
5. The milestone commit is pushed to `origin/perf/unified-regalloc`.
6. The migration log records coverage, exact promotions, rejected experiments,
   and the remaining population for the 60%-to-100% continuation.
