dccprof.py - correlate an ntvcm "-g:<file>" per-PC execution-count profile
with dcc-generated .PRN/.SYM listings, producing:
  - a Markdown summary ranking the hottest functions
  - annotated listings (app + touched RTL routines), each in two forms:
      .txt  - a per-line cycle count and opcode bytes prefixed onto every
              instruction line, directly viewable/searchable in any editor
      .html - the same content, self-contained, with each line's cycle count
              cell color-coded on a log-scaled heatmap (open in a browser)

This is the formalized version of the ad-hoc address-correlation scripts
built by hand during interactive profiling investigations this session
(bucket.py -> bucket2.py -> bucket3.py) - see the two lessons that made
those iterations necessary, both handled correctly here:

  1. RTL code and app code are assembled STANDALONE (their own .PRN, its own
     from-zero addresses) before being linked together at final addresses
     that differ from those standalone addresses - and by DIFFERENT amounts
     for the RTL vs the app, since each is a separate module in the final
     link. Two independently-computed offsets are required (one per
     module), found by matching one known symbol's address between that
     module's own standalone .PRN and the final linked .SYM.

  2. A dcc/M80-style .PRN listing's address column is the address AFTER the
     current line's own emitted bytes (i.e. where the NEXT line's bytes
     begin), not the current line's own starting address - confirmed against
     known Z80 instruction encodings (e.g. "push ix" is 2 bytes; if it is
     immediately preceded by a label at address 0000, "push ix" itself is
     listed with address 0002, not 0000). A line's own true starting
     address is therefore the PREVIOUS line's listed address (or the
     module's base address for the first line). Getting this backwards
     silently shifts every cycle count by one listing line - there is no
     crash to reveal the mistake, so this is verified against several
     independent instructions of different byte-lengths before trusting it
     anywhere in this file.

Usage:
    dccprof.py --app NAME --build-dir DIR --profile-csv FILE [--out-dir DIR]

Designed for two audiences equally:
  - scripts/dccprof.sh / dccprof.bat, which build + run an app under the
    profiler and then call this tool to produce the final report.
  - direct, ad-hoc invocation against an already-built app + an
    already-captured profile.csv, exactly the workflow used throughout this
    session's own performance investigations - point this at the same
    build directory instead of hand-rolling a new correlation script next
    time.

# Function-boundary attribution: walk one module's parsed lines and assign
# every line to the most recent "owning" function name, using the same
# two patterns dcc's own codegen and DCCRTL.MAC both use for a function's
# entry label - collected as a set of candidate names first (a hand-written
# RTL routine may pre-declare a whole batch of "public NAME" entry points
# far above the labels they actually apply to - see this file's own module
# docstring), then matched against each label as it's encountered.
#
# A label matching neither pattern is normally left attributed to whatever
# function came before it - correct for an ordinary internal label (a loop
# target, an early-return merge point, etc. - all reached by falling
# through or branching from that same function's own preceding code, no
# matter what instruction happens to sit textually just above the label).
# An EARLIER version of this function instead asked "was the previous line
# an unconditional ret/jp/jr" - plausible-sounding, but wrong: those are
# completely ordinary within a single routine's own control flow (an early-
# return path's own "ret" immediately followed by the label the normal
# path merges back into, e.g.), so that check fired constantly on labels
# that were never anything but a continuation of the current function,
# fragmenting it into several spuriously-separate rows.
#
# The one pattern that DOES need special handling is different and much
# narrower: a label reached directly after one or more "public NAME" lines
# that have not yet been matched to any label at all - a shared preamble
# several public entry points jump INTO from below, pre-declared together
# far above it (see PrnListing's own public_names collection). This is
# exactly DCCRTL.MAC's DRSU: __divu/__modu/__divs/__mods are all declared
# public together, then DRSU's own label (matching none of those four
# names) follows directly - and without this check, DRSU's execution
# count (the vast majority of a division-heavy program's total) was
# silently misattributed to __conout, merely because __conout was the
# last successfully-matched public function several dozen lines above.
# Once DRSU is recognized here, __divu's own eventual "__divu:" label
# further down correctly reclaims the rest of that shared implementation,
# exactly as it always did for a directly-matching label.

# cycle count's own cell background color-coded (a one-hue sequential ramp,
# log-scaled so a handful of dominant loop bodies don't wash out everything
# else down at bucket 1). Plain text can't carry that, hence a second
# format alongside (not instead of) the grep/search-friendly .txt.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Sequential blue ramp, light->dark (6 buckets pulled from a 13-step scale)
# paired with the text color that stays readable on each: bucket 0 is "no
# cycles" and gets no fill at all, so a mostly-cold listing still reads as
# plain code, not a wall of pale blue.
