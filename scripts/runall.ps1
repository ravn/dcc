.SYNOPSIS
Comprehensive test suite: builds and runs all test applications with output
verification against baseline.

.DESCRIPTION
Builds all *.c files in tests/ folder using dccmake, executes each under the
emulator, and compares output against per-app baselines in tests/baselines/
(one <app>.txt per test). Comparison is keyed by app name, so test discovery
order does not matter. Uses tests/_test_overrides.json for test-specific arguments and
stack sizes. After the app suite, also runs the compile-fail diagnostics suite
via scripts/run-diagnostics.ps1 and fails the run if any diagnostic baseline
mismatches.

Pass -Extended to also run scripts/runall-extended.ps1 after the main app suite,
verifying the imported c-testsuite single-exec corpus as part of the same run.

Supports per-test arguments (e.g., ttt with "10" as input) and custom stack
size overrides (e.g., cobint needs 1536 bytes, triangle needs 768).

Pass -Report to append per-app metrics to a CSV report while the suite runs; no
separate benchmark pass is required, and it runs in parallel like a normal
suite run. Report mode disables stack checking (so the measurements reflect a
normal, non-debug build), but every run - Report or not - always uses ntvcm's
full, unthrottled speed (`-s:0`) and passes -p so ntvcm emits its own Z80 cycle
count at app exit. The report records, per optimisation mode, that cycle count
(host-independent), the .COM size, and an "ms at ReportClockHz" figure computed
by simple arithmetic from the cycle count (cycles / ReportClockHz * 1000) - not
measured by actually pacing the emulator down to that clock speed, which for a
cycle-heavy app at a nominal historical clock rate could turn a sub-second run
into many minutes of real wall-clock time for no benefit, since the exact same
number is one division away from the cycle count ntvcm already reports at full
speed:
    machine,os,utc-timestamp,app,peep_ms,peep_cycles,peep_size,
    nopeep_ms,nopeep_cycles,nopeep_size,clock_hz

.PARAMETER Emulator
  Emulator command to run .COM files (default: "ntvcm").

.PARAMETER NoStackCheck
  Disable the lightweight stack-overflow guard (-fstack-check). The guard is
  ON by default for all apps; pass -NoStackCheck to build without it.

.PARAMETER BuildDir
  Working directory for build artifacts (default: "build").

.PARAMETER BaselineDir
  Directory of per-app baseline files for verification (default: "tests/baselines").
  Each file is named <app>.txt and holds that app's exact expected stdout.

.PARAMETER Mode
    Which optimization pass(es) to build and verify (default: "fast"):
    fast   - optimized (runs the dccpeep peephole optimizer)
    nopeep - unoptimized (skips dccpeep)
    full   - builds and verifies each app twice, once per mode, against the
             same baseline (two builds per app)

.PARAMETER Help
    Show this help text and exit without building or running tests.

.PARAMETER Extended
    Also run the extended c-testsuite single-exec corpus after the main app suite.

.PARAMETER Serial
  Build and verify apps sequentially in the shared build directory. By default
  the suite runs in parallel; use -Serial as a fallback (e.g. for debugging or
  on constrained machines).

.PARAMETER ThrottleLimit
  Max concurrent apps in parallel mode (default: CPU core count).

.PARAMETER Report
    Append per-app performance metrics to the historical, multi-machine report
    CSV (see ReportFile). Implies -NoStackCheck (so the measurements reflect a
    normal, non-debug build); runs in parallel like a normal suite run, and at
    ntvcm's full unthrottled speed (-s:0) like a normal run too - the reported
    "ms" figure is computed from the Z80 cycle count (see ReportClockHz), not
    measured by actually pacing the emulator down to a slower clock. This is a
    separate, opt-in, cross-machine performance log - it is NOT what backs the
    on-by-default cycle-count regression check below (see PerfBaselineFile),
    which needs no separate pass at all.

.PARAMETER ReportFile
    CSV path for -Report output (default: "perf_results.csv").

.PARAMETER ReportClockHz
    Nominal clock speed (Hz) used to compute the "ms" figure recorded in
    -Report's CSV from ntvcm's reported Z80 cycle count (ms = cycles / this *
    1000). Default: 400000000. Purely arithmetic - does not affect how fast
    ntvcm actually runs the app (always -s:0, full speed).

.PARAMETER NoPerfCheck
    Skip the Z80 cycle-count regression check against PerfBaselineFile. The
    check is ON by default and adds no separate run: every app already passes
    -p to ntvcm, so its cycle count is parsed out of the same execution
    already done for output verification, in whichever mode(s) this invocation
    builds (-Mode fast/nopeep/full). The Z80 cycle count ntvcm reports is a
    pure instruction-count total from the emulated CPU, independent of host
    scheduling, so it is exactly as reliable measured under -ThrottleLimit
    parallelism as it would be serially - no need to force -Serial for it.

    The check itself is skipped (regardless of this switch) whenever
    -NoStackCheck or -Report is in effect: the stack-check guard adds a
    prologue check to every function, so a build without it is not
    cycle-count-comparable to the baseline (captured under a plain default
    run) at all - every app would show some spurious difference having
    nothing to do with a real codegen change.

.PARAMETER UpdatePerfBaseline
    Instead of comparing against PerfBaselineFile, (re)write it from this run's
    measured cycle counts and .COM sizes. Only the column(s) for the mode(s)
    this invocation actually built are touched (peep_cycles/peep_size for
    -Mode fast, nopeep_cycles/nopeep_size for -Mode nopeep, all four for
    -Mode full) - any other app/column already in the file is left untouched.
    Use after an intentional, verified change moves cycle counts or .COM
    sizes (an improvement, or an accepted tradeoff).

.PARAMETER PerfBaselineFile
    CSV path for the cycle-count and .COM-size regression baseline (default:
    "tests/perf_baselines.csv"). One row per app, columns app,peep_cycles,
    nopeep_cycles,peep_size,nopeep_size. Checked into the repo like the
    output baselines in tests/baselines/, so a regression shows up as a diff
    in code review the same way an output-baseline change would. Size
    catches a class of regression cycle count alone cannot: dead code linked
    in but never executed (e.g. dccrtlstrip pulling in an RTL block a
    program never calls, because it happens to share a keep/strip unit with
    one it does) changes nothing on any executed path, so it's invisible to
    cycle counts but shows up immediately as a larger .COM.

.PARAMETER NarrowDiff
    After the main suite, build every app a second and third time - once
    normally, once with dcc's -fno-narrow (every int-array/scalar/for-counter
    byte-narrowing pass disabled) - and diff the two runs' raw stdout directly
    against each other, instead of against a recorded baseline. Narrowing is
    supposed to be invisible (a storage-width optimization, never a value
    change), so any difference is a real correctness bug in a narrowing pass -
    caught without needing an external reference compiler, and without the
    bug needing to already be reflected in some existing baseline's expected
    text. Off by default (extra build+run work per app); a mismatch fails the
    run just like an output-baseline mismatch does.

.PARAMETER KeepBuild
    In parallel mode the suite builds into a per-invocation folder
    (build/run-<pid>) so concurrent runs stay isolated, and removes it on exit to
    keep build/ from accumulating run-* folders. Pass -KeepBuild to retain that
    folder (e.g. to inspect failing build artifacts).

.PARAMETER TimingBreakdown
    Print a percentage breakdown of where wall-clock time went, for
    diagnosing suite-level slowdowns. Two sections:
      - Top-level phases (main app suite / perf check / diagnostics /
        dccpeep fixtures / narrow-diff / extended suite), each as a % of
        this run's total time - the same stopwatches already used for
        "Total time" above, just also reported per phase.
      - Build pipeline, aggregated across every app and mode built by the
        main suite: dcc / dccpeep / m80 assembly / dccrtlstrip / L80 link
        (each summed from a per-phase wall-clock timing line dccmake itself
        now prints - see src/dccmake/dccmake.c's now_ms()/run_build), plus
        the ntvcm execution time already captured for the cycle-count check.
        Both dccmake's own reported total and ntvcm's own reported elapsed
        milliseconds are measured from INSIDE those processes, so they
        exclude the actual OS process-create/exec cost and PowerShell's own
        overhead capturing/merging their output via 2>&1 - comparing each
        against a PowerShell-side Stopwatch wrapping the same call splits
        that out into its own "dccmake spawn" / "ntvcm spawn" bucket, with
        whatever's left (fixture staging, baseline comparison, parallel
        dispatch/collection) in a final "other script" bucket. This second
        section is normalized to the sum of all apps' work, NOT wall-clock
        time (parallel execution makes wall-clock time much smaller than
        that sum) - it answers "of all the work the suite did, what fraction
        was which pipeline stage", not "what fraction of the run's wall
        time".

.NOTES
  App overrides are loaded from tests/_test_overrides.json:
    - args: command-line arguments for the app
        - stdin: text piped to app stdin during execution
    - stack_size: C stack reserve override (default 512)
    - fixtures: CP/M data files (from tests/) this app reads at runtime,
      copied into its build dir under their UPPERCASE name before it runs -
      e.g. cobint needs E.COB, but no other app does, so only cobint
      declares it. Most apps read/write only their own scratch files and
      need no fixtures at all (the default, an empty list).
    - ignore: set to true to skip building/running this app
    - perf_ignore: set to true to exclude this app from the cycle-count
      regression check entirely (never a regression, improvement, or new
      baseline) - for a test whose cycle count is known to vary run-to-run
      for reasons unrelated to codegen, e.g. tkbd (a keyboard-poll loop whose
      iteration count depends on real host timing) or tdirent/cpmenumd
      (directory enumeration order depends on real filesystem state).
    - narrow_diff_ignore: set to true to exclude this app from -NarrowDiff
      entirely - for a test whose observable output is inherently sensitive
      to overall stack/frame layout in a way unrelated to any narrowing bug,
      e.g. tstackov/tpragstk (both intentionally recurse until the
      stack-check guard fires, and print exactly how far the stack
      overran - narrowing shrinks locals elsewhere in the program, shifting
      that number even though nothing is actually wrong).

  Cycle-count regression checking (on by default, see NoPerfCheck above) only
  compares/updates the mode(s) actually built this run - run with -Mode full
  (or run both -Mode fast and -Mode nopeep separately) to keep both columns of
  tests/perf_baselines.csv current.

  Exit codes:
    0 = all tests passed (including no cycle-count regression)
    1 = one or more tests failed, or a performance regression was found
